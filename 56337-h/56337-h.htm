<small>SAM MAKES A PURCHASE</small></h2>
</div>


<p>It was a window to gladden any boy’s heart. Behind
the big plate-glass pane were baseball bats
of all sorts and prices, masks and protectors,
gloves and mitts, balls peeking temptingly forth
from their tin-foil wrappers, golf clubs and bags,
running shoes and apparel, and many, many other
things to send a chap’s hand diving into his
pocket.</p>

<p>Sam Craig’s hand was already there, jingling
the few coins he had with him, while his gaze
wandered raptly over the enticing array. Always,
though, it returned to the display of catcher’s
mitts.</p>

<p>He was seventeen, a sturdy, brown-haired youth
with a well-tanned face from which dark grey eyes
looked untroubledly forth. As he stood there in
front of Cummings and Wright’s window his feet
were planted apart, his attitude seeming to say:
“Here I am and here I stay!” And the resolute<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
expression of his face backed up the assertion of
his body, so that, had you for any reason wished
to move Sam from in front of that window, it
would never have occurred to you to try force.
If persuasion failed you’d have let him stay
there!</p>

<p>You wouldn’t have called Sam handsome, although,
judged separately, his features were all
good. His nose was straight and short, his eyes
thoughtful, his mouth fairly wide and firm, and
his chin purposeful. What you might have mistaken
for a dimple in the cleft of the chin was
in reality only a tiny scar, the result of collision
with the point of a newly sharpened pencil caused
by a fall on an icy sidewalk many years before.
When accounting for that scar Sam was wont to
indulge in one of his infrequent jokes. There was,
he would tell you, a queer coincidence about it;
it had happened in Faber-ary. If, through ignorance
of the brand of pencils affected in Amesville,
you missed the point of the joke, Sam didn’t
explain it. He had evolved that pun all himself,
and, not being addicted to airy persiflage, thought
rather well of it. Consequently, if you didn’t
catch it, Sam thought poorly of your sense of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
humour and wasted no effort on you. He appreciated
jokes when he heard them, but seldom perpetrated
one himself. And his appreciation was
seldom demonstrative. When others laughed Sam
confined himself to a slight lifting of one corner
of his mouth and a quizzical expression in his calm
grey eyes. When others doubled themselves over
and frankly shouted their amusement, Sam merely
chuckled.</p>

<p>He was captain of the Amesville High School
Baseball Team. When, two days after the final
contest with Petersburg, a contest which had resulted
in a victory for Amesville and given the
Brown-and-Blue the season’s championship, the
players had met to choose a leader for the next
year, the honour had gone to Sam. Probably had
Tom Pollock, whose heady pitching had done
more than anything else to win the Petersburg
series, been in his final year at high school, the
captaincy would have gone to him by acclamation.
But Tom was still a junior and it was the custom
to elect a senior, and, with Tom out of it, the
choice fell naturally on Sam. The school at large
was well satisfied. Sam Craig was well liked. It
would be stretching a point to say that he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
popular, for he was quiet, unassuming, and kept
pretty much to himself, and in consequence made
friends slowly. Certainly he was not socially popular
as was Sidney Morris, nor was he hailed as
a hero as was Tom Pollock. But he was liked and
respected, and, if he wasn’t called a hero, few
failed to realise that his steady, always cool-headed
and sometimes brilliant work behind the
bat had had more than a little to do with the
successful outcome of the season just finished.
Sam’s election had been made unanimous, Sam
had faltered a much embarrassed speech of acceptance,
and the team had disbanded for the summer.</p>

<p>To-day, a bright, warm morning in the latter
part of June and just over a week after the election,
Sam was seriously debating a momentous
question, which was whether to deplete his slender
hoard of spending-money for one of the brand-new
mitts lying so temptingly beyond the glass, or to
save his money and make his old one, a thing of
many honourable scars, do him until next spring.
If, he told himself, he had a lot of money, there
were many things in that window he would buy: a
new ball—his own had been several times restitched—a
new mask and—yes, by jingo, if he could afford<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
it!—one of those dandy black-tipped bats bearing
the facsimile signature of a noted Big Leaguer.
More than once his hand came out of his pocket
and more than once he half turned away, but each
time his fingers went back to the coins again, and,
at last, he entered the wide, hospitably open door
of the big hardware and sporting-goods store. If
he had not done so this story would have been
far different, for more than the purchase of a
catcher’s mitt resulted from his visit that morning
to Cummings and Wright’s.</p>

<p>The front of the store, to the left as you entered,
was devoted to the sporting goods. The
department was only about two years old, but already
it had thrice outgrown its limit, until now it
occupied fully a third of the store’s space. There
were racks of golf clubs, shelves filled with enticing
boxes, handsome show-cases over which a red-blooded
boy could hang entranced for a long time,
polished counters holding things cunningly displayed,
and, between window and cases, an oak-topped
desk, at which a boy of about Sam’s age
was busily writing. He was a capable-looking
fellow, with much red-brown hair and a pair of
frank and honest blue eyes and a nice smile. And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
the smile appeared the minute he glanced up from
the letter he was writing and glimpsed Sam over
the top of the desk.</p>

<p>“Hello!” he said, jumping up. “Haven’t seen
you since they made you captain, Sam. How are
you?”</p>

<p>“All right,” said Sam, viewing him, with his
quizzical smile, across the bat-rack. “Say, Tom,
I want to buy a mitt. How much do I have to
pay?”</p>

<p>“Oh, we never tell you that till we’ve shown you
the goods,” laughed Tom Pollock. “What you
want is one of these, Sam. It’s just like your old
one, I think, and you can’t beat it at any price.
We’ve got them for more money, but——”</p>

<p>“This is all right, thanks.” Sam thrust a hand
into the black leather mitt and thumped it experimentally
with his right fist. “How much,
Tom?”</p>

<p>“Well, you get the team discount, Sam.” Tom
tore a piece of paper from a pad and figured on
it. Then he pushed it toward Sam, and Sam read
the result, hesitated momentarily, and then nodded.</p>

<p>“All right,” he said, “I’ll take it. You needn’t
do it up.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<p>“Going to wear it home?” asked Tom, with a
laugh. “By the way, Morris was talking the
other day about getting the Blues together again
this summer. You’ll play if we do, won’t you?”</p>

<p>“I guess so. I don’t know yet. I’m looking for
a job, Tom. Know anyone who wants to hire a
strong, willing chap like me?”</p>

<p>Tom smiled and shook his head. “I’m afraid I
don’t, Sam.”</p>

<p>“I went over to see Harper at the mills yesterday
and got a sort of half promise of a job in
the packing-room later. I’m not crazy about that,
though. Maybe I’m lazy, but they sure do work
you hard over there. I worked in the stock-room
one summer and nearly passed out! And hot!”</p>

<p>“Must be,” Tom agreed. “Wish I did know of
something, Sam, but——” He paused and glanced
toward his desk. Then, “By Jove!” he muttered.
“I wonder—Look here, Sam, mind going away
from home?”</p>

<p>“How far? Where to?”</p>

<p>“Indian Lake.”</p>

<p>“Where’s that?”</p>

<p>“Up toward Mendon. About a hundred and
twenty miles north of here.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p>“What’s up there? Say, it isn’t peddling books,
is it? I tried that one time and nearly starved to
death. Sold four sets of Murray’s Compendium
of Universal History and cleared just eleven dollars
and eighty cents in a month!”</p>

<p>Tom smiled. “No, it’s—— Here’s—here’s the
letter I got this morning. You can read it for
yourself. I don’t know why they wrote to me
unless this chap has bought goods from us. I
haven’t looked him up yet.”</p>

<p>Sam took the brief typewritten letter and read
it. It was addressed to “Manager Sporting
Goods Department, Cummings and Wright, Amesville,
Ohio,” and was as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="noic">“Respectfully,</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Warren Langham</span>, Director.”<br /></p>
</div>

<p>The letter was typed on a sheet of paper bearing
at the top the legend: “The Wigwam; a Summer
Camp for Boys, Indian Lake, Ohio. Warren
Bradley Langham, A.M., Director.”</p>

<p>Sam read it twice, the second time more
thoughtfully. Then he looked questioningly at
Tom.</p>

<p>“Interest you?” asked the latter. “If I could
take it I’d do it in a minute, Sam.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but this man’s looking for someone a
heap older than I am, I guess, Tom, although he
doesn’t say anything about age. ‘A young man’;
that’s all.”</p>

<p>“Well, aren’t you a young man?”</p>

<p>“I’m young,” agreed Sam, “but I’m no man
yet. Anyway, I suppose I couldn’t go so far.
There’s just my mother and Nell at home——”</p>

<p>“It would be only about nine weeks, though.
The pay isn’t big, but——”</p>

<p>“The pay’s all right, Tom, because I’d be getting
my board, you see. The only thing would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
be leaving my folks alone so long. Still——”
Sam thoughtfully fondled the catcher’s mitt.</p>

<p>“You could give him all the references he
wanted,” urged Tom.</p>

<p>“Who from?” asked the other doubtfully.
“What sort of references?”</p>

<p>“Why, from your minister and your school
principal, of course.”</p>

<p>“Oh! Well, what about handling boys? I
never handled any. And what about helping
to instruct in athletics?”</p>

<p>“He doesn’t say that you must be <em>used</em> to handling
them; only that you must know something
about it. You do, don’t you?”</p>

<p>Sam looked blank. “Do I?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Of course you do! Any fellow does who has
sense and has been a kid himself.” Tom laughed.
“You’re too modest, Sam. Throw out your
chest! Aren’t you captain of the Amesville High
School Nine? As for instructing in athletics,
why, all that means is that you’ll have to play
ball with the kids and arrange running and jumping
stunts and—— Say, you can swim, can’t
you?”</p>

<p>“Yes.” Sam seemed quite decided about that.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>“There you are, then! You take the letter and
write to Mr. Whatshisname right off.”</p>

<p>“I’d like to,” mused Sam. “I’d like the
job.”</p>

<p>“Take it then! I’ll drop the man a note and tell
him I’ve got just the fellow for him; baseball captain,
all-around athlete, fine swimmer, highly
moral, and a wonder at handling boys! How’s
that?”</p>

<p>“Pack of lies,” replied Sam, with a smile. “You
let me take this letter and I’ll think it over to-night
and talk to mother and Nell about it and
see you in the morning. If they think it’s all right
maybe I’ll try for it. Just the same, I know
mighty well he’ll think I’m too young.”</p>

<p>“In years, maybe,” said Tom, “but in experience,
Sam!” Tom shook his head knowingly.
“It’s experience that counts, my boy.”</p>

<p>“You’re a chump,” said Sam. “Mind if I take
this, though?”</p>

<p>“Not a bit. Let me know in the morning, Sam.
Joking aside, I think it would be a first-rate thing.
You’d come back in September simply full of
health and able to lick your weight in bear-cats.
We’ll miss you, though, if we get the ball team<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
together again. Who could we get to catch for us,
Sam?”</p>

<p>“Buster Healey.”</p>

<p>“That’s so, he might do. Anything else I can
sell you, Sam?”</p>

<p>“No, I guess not. Did I pay you for this?”</p>

<p>“Not yet. You needn’t if you don’t want to.
Let me charge it to you.”</p>

<p>“No, thanks,” said Sam hurriedly, diving for
his money. “If I get that place I’ll need this
mitt, I guess. I’ve been trying to persuade myself
all the morning that I really ought to have
it.”</p>

<p>“Another reason for accepting the job, Sam,”
said Tom cheerfully. “It’ll justify your extravagance.”</p>

<p>“That’s putting ’em over,” said Sam, with a
chuckle. “‘Justify your extravagance!’ Gee,
Tom, that’s real language, that is!”</p>

<p>“Yes, right in the groove, Sam. Say, I’d like to
get out and pitch a few. What are you doing this
evening? Let’s get a ball and see how it feels.
Will you? Good stuff! Drop around here at five
and get me.”</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II</a><br />
<small>OFF FOR CAMP</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Sam gave his new mitt a good try-out that evening.
He and Tom and Tom’s particular chum, Sid
Morris, took possession of the alley behind the
hardware store and, admiringly regarded by a
dozen or so small boys, pitched and caught until
supper-time. Sidney, a slim, lithe, handsome chap
of nearly eighteen, had been told about The Wigwam
and, like Tom, sighed because he could not
accept the position himself.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you what, though, Sam,” he said, as
he made an imaginary swing at the ball just before
it thumped into Sam’s new glove, “if you go
up there Tom and I will come and visit you for a
day or two. I suppose they’d let us, wouldn’t
they, Tom?”</p>

<p>“I don’t see how they could stop us visiting the
place, but they might object to our staying overnight.
Here goes for a knuckle-ball, Sam. Watch
it.” But the attempt was not successful and Tom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
shook his head as the ball came back to him. “I
guess I’ll never make much out of that,” he said.
“What’s that, Sam? Four fingers? I can’t see
very well. All right, here she goes.” A slow
ball sped across the imaginary plate and Sidney,
making believe to swing and miss, uttered a disappointed
grunt and angrily slanged a non-existent
umpire, to the delight of the gallery. It was
time to stop then, and, pocketing his ball, Tom
accompanied Sam and Sidney to Main Street and,
after Sidney had jumped a car to hurry home to
dinner, detained Sam a minute on a corner.</p>

<p>“Made up your mind yet?” he asked.</p>

<p>Sam hesitated a moment. “Mother wants me
to try for it,” he said, “and Nell, too, but I don’t
know as I ought to leave them so long.”</p>

<p>“Well, you know best, Sam. Only, if you can
do it you’d better. You know as well as I do that
there’s mighty little chance of a fellow’s getting
work in Amesville in summer, except at the mills;
and they don’t pay anything over there.”</p>

<p>Sam nodded agreement. “I guess,” he answered
thoughtfully, “I’ll write and see what Mr.
Langham says. I suppose, though, he will tell me
I’m too young.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p>“How would it do,” asked Tom, “to say nothing
about your age? He didn’t seem particular
about that, you know. Just tell him you’re in your
senior year at high school and are captain of the
nine; and that you think you could hold down the
place to the King’s taste, and so on!”</p>

<p>“I might, only—I’d feel pretty cheap if I got
up there and he told me I wouldn’t do. Besides, it
wouldn’t be quite honest, I guess.”</p>

<p>“I suppose not. No, you’d better tell him you’re
nearly eighteen.”</p>

<p>“But I’m not,” objected Sam gravely. “I won’t
be until December.”</p>

<p>“Then tell him you’re well over seventeen,”
laughed Tom. “Anyway, make yourself out as
old as you can, you fussy old chump! And don’t
be too modest. I don’t know but that I ought to
see that letter before you send it, Sam.”</p>

<p>Sam shook his head. “I’ll do it all right,” he
said. “And you write to him, too, if you don’t
mind.”</p>

<p>“I’ll do it this evening. So long. You ought
to get an answer by Friday, I should think. I hope
it comes out all right, Sam.”</p>

<p>“So do I,” said Sam soberly. “It would be a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
dandy job if I could get it. Good night, Tom, and
thank you for telling me about it.”</p>

<p>That wasn’t an easy letter to write, as Sam discovered
later when, with the assistance of his
mother and sister, he set about its composition.
Nell, a pretty girl a year older than Sam, scored
his first draft indignantly.</p>

<p>“Why, you haven’t said a thing about what you
can do,” she exclaimed. “You’ve just told him
what you <em>can’t</em>! The idea of saying that you’re a
fair swimmer! You know very well, Sam, that
you’re a perfect wonder in the water.”</p>

<p>“Pshaw, lots of fellows can swim better than
I do.”</p>

<p>“No one around here, anyway. And you practically
tell him that you don’t know a thing about
looking after young boys.”</p>

<p>“I don’t!”</p>

<p>“But you don’t have to say so, do you? Now,
you write that all over and—I tell you what, Sam!
Write it just as if you were trying to get the
place for someone else!”</p>

<p>Finally both Nell and Mrs. Craig approved, and
Sam made a clean copy of the letter, slipped it
into an envelope, stamped and addressed it, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
went out to the mail box with it so it would be
gathered up at eleven-thirty and go off on the
early morning train. Now that he had made up
his mind to get the position if he could he was
impatient to learn his fate.</p>

<p>But three days passed without any response
and he had begun to think that nothing was to
come of his application, when one afternoon a
messenger boy brought a telegram. It was extremely
brief.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Mail references immediately. <span class="smcap">Langham.</span>”</p>
</div>

<p>“It doesn’t look as though he thought you too
young,” said Tom when, later, Sam dropped in
at Cummings and Wright’s to tell the news. “If
he did he wouldn’t bother with your references.
I guess you’ve got it, Sam.”</p>

<p>And Sam acknowledged that it looked so. The
letters of reference went off that evening, one
from the High School principal and one from the
minister of the church Sam attended. Both were,
he considered, undeservedly flattering. They bore
immediate result. Just thirty-four hours later
another telegram arrived, this time not quite so
brief.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Satisfactory. Join camp July fifth. Rail to
East Mendon, stage to Indian Lake. Bring grey
flannel trousers, blue sleeveless shirt, sweater,
sneakers, mackintosh. <span class="smcap">Langham.</span>”</p></div>

<p>They referred to that telegram at intervals all
day. Sam was a bit troubled because it said nothing
about socks or a hat, but Nell said she supposed
Mr. Langham gave him credit for enough
sense to bring such things without being told.</p>

<p>“He doesn’t say whether the sweater has to be
any special colour, either,” mused Sam. “Mine’s
grey.”</p>

<p>“That thing!” exclaimed Nell scathingly.
“Why, mother’s darned that and darned it, Sam.
It isn’t fit to be seen in. You must have a new
one.”</p>

<p>“Gee, if I buy a new sweater besides all those
other things I won’t have any money left! I asked
Miller, at the station, what the fare to Indian Lake
is and he said it’s four dollars and sixty
cents.”</p>

<p>“I don’t care, Sam, you can’t take that old
sweater. You can get a new one for three dollars,
I guess.”</p>

<p>“Can’t afford it,” said Sam decisively.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>“Then I’ll present it to you. I’ve got a lot of
money.”</p>

<p>“I think,” said Mrs. Craig, “it would be nice
if Nellie and I bought those things for you, dear.
How much would they cost, do you think?”</p>

<p>Sam demurred, but in the end they had their
way, and the next morning Sam set out to Cummings
and Wright’s with his precious telegram
in hand and laid the matter before Tom Pollock.</p>

<p>“So you got it!” exclaimed Tom. “Gee, but
I’m awfully glad, Sam! Shake! Now let’s see
what you need. What shade of blue do you suppose
that means? Dark, I guess. Here you are,
then. Eighty-five cents each. You’ll need two
of them. Sneakers are ninety-five and a dollar
and a quarter. Better pay the difference, Sam.
The cheaper ones aren’t much. What about flannel
trousers? I’m afraid—Oh, you’ve got a pair?
All right. Then that leaves only the sweater.
What colour?”</p>

<p>“It doesn’t say. What do you think?”</p>

<p>“Guess it doesn’t matter, Sam. Grey’s usually
the best because it won’t fade and doesn’t show
dirt, but you can have blue or red or white or——”</p>

<p>“Grey, I guess; and not very expensive.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>“Here’s one for two and a half and here’s a
better one for three and here’s——”</p>

<p>“I guess this three-dollar one will do, Tom. Do
I get anything off on this truck?”</p>

<p>“Certainly; fifteen off, Sam. That makes it—let
me see—five dollars and six cents; call it
five dollars even, Sam. What about the raincoat?”</p>

<p>“I’ve got an old one that will do, I guess. You
see, I don’t want to spend very much, because the
fare up there and back comes to over nine dollars,
and that’s two weeks’ wages.”</p>

<p>“He didn’t say anything about paying your
fare, then?”</p>

<p>Sam shook his head. “He wouldn’t, would he?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. Seems to me he ought to pay
it one way, at least, though, Sam. I’d mention it
to him, anyway.”</p>

<p>“Maybe I will,” replied Sam doubtfully.
“Well, I guess that’s all, then. I’ll take these
things along with me. How many boys do you
suppose there will be up there, Tom?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. Maybe forty or fifty. And
look here, Sam.” Tom walked around the counter
when he had finished tying up the bundle and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
seated himself on the edge, swinging his legs.
“Don’t do this,” he explained, “when there’s customers
around. Look here, Sam. About those
kids, now. Take my advice and start ’em off
right.”</p>

<p>“How do you mean, Tom?”</p>

<p>“I mean make ’em understand right away that
you won’t take any nonsense from them. Of
course, a summer camp’s different from a school,
I suppose, and there’s a lot more—more give-and-take
between the councillors and the boys, but it’s
a good idea, I guess, to make the kids understand
that while you love ’em all to death you aren’t
going to tell ’em to do a thing more than once.
Get the idea? Kind but firm, Sam.”</p>

<p>“Anyone would think you invented boys’
camps,” said Sam, with a twinkle. Tom laughed.</p>

<p>“Never you mind whether I did or not, Sam.
You do as I tell you and you’ll find things going
easier. You aren’t enough older than the boys to
make ’em much scared of you, so you want to
hold the reins pretty tight at first. No charge for
the advice. When do you go?”</p>

<p>“Seven-ten on the fifth. That gets me to East
Mendon at eleven-twenty. Then there’s a stage-coach<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
or something that goes over to the Lake
at two.”</p>

<p>“I’ll go down and see you off, Sam, and wish
you luck.”</p>

<p>And a week later Tom kept his promise. He
and Sidney escorted Sam to the train, Tom carrying
the traveller’s old-fashioned yellow leather
valise and Sid his raincoat, leaving Sam the free
use of both hands with which to satisfy himself
every two or three moments that his ticket was
safe. There was one excruciating minute when
they reached Locust Street, and were in sight of the
station, when Sam couldn’t find the ticket in any
of his pockets and blank dismay overspread his
countenance. He was on the verge of retracing
his steps when Sidney patiently reminded him that
just one block back he had placed the precious
pasteboard in the lining of his straw hat for safe-keeping.
Sam said, “Oh!” and looked extremely
foolish, and, amidst the laughter of his guard of
honour, the journey began again.</p>

<p>News of Sam’s departure had spread through
town and there was quite a gathering of friends to
see him off. Buster Healey was there, with a
bouquet consisting of two sprays of gladiolus,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
mostly in bud, which Buster was suspected of having
acquired by the simple expedient of reaching
through someone’s garden fence; and Tommy
Hughes was there, and Joe Kenny, and half a
dozen more; and there was a good deal of noise
and rough-house until the train pulled into the
station and Sam climbed aboard. You might have
thought that Sam was leaving for the Grand Tour
or for a year in Darkest Africa. All kinds of advice
was showered on him. He was instructed not
to put his head out the window, not to speak to
strangers, not to take any wooden money, and not
to lose his ticket. Then the train moved and a
cheer went up and a much embarrassed Sam waved
good-bye from a window. And at that moment
Buster discovered that Sam had left his flowers
on a baggage truck, and rescued them and raced
the length of the platform before he was finally
able to hurl them in at the window. So began
the journey.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III</a><br />
<small>“THE WIGWAM”</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Sam had never done much travelling. He had been
to Columbus twice and had journeyed around
more or less within a fifty-mile radius of Amesville,
but penetrating a hundred and twenty-odd
miles into the wilds of northern Ohio was something
new and not a little exciting. There had
never, particularly since his father had died, been
much money for railroad tickets and sight-seeing.
Sam’s father had been a railroad engineer, and a
good one. For many years when Sam was just
a little chap Mr. Craig had held the throttle on
the big Mogul engine that had pulled the Western
Mail through Amesville. Sam didn’t see a
great deal of his father in those days, for Mr.
Craig “laid-over” in Amesville but twice a week,
and the days when he did see him were red-letter
days. He had been very fond of his dad,
and very proud of him, too; and it had been Sam’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
earnest desire to grow up quick and be an engineer
too. When, however, in Sam’s twelfth
year, Mr. Craig returned home for the last time
on a stretcher to live but a few hours, Sam lost
that desire. For once the engineer had not been
held to blame for an accident; a muddle-headed
despatcher had sent the Western Mail crashing
into a through freight between sidings; and so the
railroad paid a pension to the widow. On this
the family had lived until Sam, first, and then
Nell, had begun to supplement the pension money
with small earnings. Sam had delivered papers,
worked in the mill as stock-boy, and tried his hand
at several other things, while Nell, having finished
school the spring before, was now a public stenographer
with a tiny room of her own in Amesville’s
new office building, and was a little more
than making expenses.</p>

<p>The first thrill of excitement wore off after a
half-hour or so, and Sam, tired of watching the
view from the car window, picked up the magazine
he had bought and settled back to read. The
train was not a fast one, and it stopped at a good
many stations and seemed disinclined at each to
take up its journey again. Nevertheless, it eventually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
did arrive at East Mendon, and Sam anxiously
collected his belongings and alighted. Inquiries
elicited the information that the stage
started at two o’clock from the other side of the
platform, shortly after the arrival of the through
express. Consequently Sam had a full two hours
and a half to wait. He checked his bag and coat
at the station and started out in search of dinner.
East Mendon was a small place, hardly more than
a full-grown village, and his choice of eating-places
was not large. The Commercial Hotel
seemed to be the principal hostelry, but Sam
knew that if he went there he would have to pay
at least seventy-five cents for his meal, and
seventy-five cents was about fifty cents more than
he cared to spend. At last, on a side street, he
came across a small and dingy restaurant which
advertised the principal dishes of the day’s menu
on a blackboard outside. Sam, his feet spread
well apart and his hands in his trousers pockets,
studied the list thoughtfully.</p>

<p>“Beef Stew with Dumplings, 15 cents.” “Corn
Beef Hash with Bread and Butter, 15 cents.”
“Baked White Fish and Fried Potatoes, 20 cents.”
“Ribs of Beef with Browned Potatoes, 25 cents.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
“Vegatable Soup with Bread and Butter, 10
cents.”</p>

<p>Sam’s eyes twinkled. “Me for that, I guess,”
he said to himself. “Vegetable soup with two
A’s sounds good. And maybe a cup of good hot
coffee and a piece of pie. I’m not awfully hungry,
anyhow.”</p>

<p>The “vegatable” soup was good and there was
plenty of it, and even if the bread proved so
crumbly that he found himself breading the butter
instead of buttering the bread, he made out
very well. But the good coffee didn’t materialize.
There was coffee, and it was hot, but Sam couldn’t
pronounce it good. Nor was the pie much better.
He suspected the little shock-haired proprietor
of having held and cherished that pie for a long,
long time!</p>

<p>Afterwards he wandered back to the principal
street of the village and bought three very green
apples for a nickel and munched them while he
tried to find interest in the store windows. But
the East Mendon stores were neither large nor
flourishing, and their window displays were not
at all enthralling. It was still only slightly after
twelve-thirty as, having exhausted the entertainments<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
of the village, he went back to the station,
got his magazine from his bag, and made himself
as comfortable as he could in a corner of the
small waiting-room. It was hot and close in there,
and smelled of dust and train smoke, but he found
a good story in the magazine and was soon lost to
everything but the adventures of the hero. That
first story was so interesting that, having finished
it, he started another, after a cursory glance about
the room which was now beginning to fill up. He
was halfway through the second story when the
express came thundering in with much screeching
of brake-shoes. The event promised excitement
and so he slipped his magazine in a pocket of his
coat, took up his bag, and went out on the platform
with the other occupants of the room.</p>

<p>It seemed at first glance that everyone was getting
out of the express and Sam had to flatten
himself against the station wall to keep from being
trod on. To his momentary surprise, most of the
arrivals appeared to be boys; there must, he
thought, be a hundred of them! Then it dawned
on him that he was getting his first look at his
future charges. When, presently, the express
went on again and the crowd on the platform had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
sorted itself out, he saw that the hundred boys
really numbered only about thirty or forty. In
age they seemed between twelve and fifteen, and
they were of all sorts; short boys and tall boys,
fat boys and thin boys, quiet boys and noisy boys.
Each had his bag beside him and most of them
were pestering the baggage-man about their
trunks. Suddenly into the mêlée about that exasperated
official pushed a broad-shouldered,
capable-looking man of twenty-two or three years.
He had a sun-browned face and wore a straw hat
with a yellow-and-blue band around it.</p>

<p>“Now then, fellows!” Sam heard him say
briskly. “Every one across to the other platform,
please. I’ll take charge of your checks.”</p>

<p>In a minute order grew out of chaos and the
boys, yielding their trunk checks, went off around
the station. Sam followed. Two stage-coaches
and four three-seated carriages were backed up
to the platform and the boys were scrambling for
outside seats on the coaches. Suit-cases and bags
were being piled on the roofs, and pandemonium
again reigned until, as before, the man with the
yellow-and-blue hat-band appeared and took
charge. “That’s enough on top now! Pile inside,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
you chaps. That’ll do. The rest of you get into
the hacks. Room for one more here, though. You
going to Indian Lake?”</p>

<p>This to Sam, who was waiting for a chance to
find a seat. Sam assented and squeezed into a
rear seat of one of the stages, aware of the other’s
puzzled regard. Evidently the man with the coloured
hat-band thought Sam a bit old to be going
to The Wigwam, and Sam wondered what Mr.
Langham would think! He was quite certain that
this was not Mr. Langham. First, because the
coloured hat-band chap was keeping a sharp eye
on a huge suit-case marked “A. A. G.,” and, second,
because it stood to reason that Mr. Langham
was a much older man.</p>

<p>Possibly the boys, too, thought Sam rather too
mature to be one of them, for they favoured him
with many curious glances as he squeezed into
his seat. He still retained his valise and, as there
was no place on the floor for it, he had to take it
in his lap and drape his raincoat over it. That
battered, old-fashioned bag occasioned more than
one amused look and whispered comment.</p>

<p>After they were all seated a long wait ensued.
A big wagon was backed up to the platform and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
the baggage-man and the drivers began the loading
of the trunks. There were a lot of them, but
fortunately many were of the small steamer
variety. Sam, whose entire wardrobe was contained
between the bulging sides of his valise,
wondered at those trunks. Finally the last one
was aboard, restless youths who had slipped from
their places scuttled back to them, the man with
the hat-band seated himself beside the driver of
one of the carriages and, with a cheer, the procession
of vehicles set out.</p>

<p>Sam had never ridden in an old-style stage-coach
before and he found the experience more
novel than comfortable. The body swayed amazingly
on its leather springs, and when, presently,
they were on the rough country road, bumped up
and down most erratically. Sam held tight to
his bag, braced his feet against the floor, and
watched the landscape unfold. Most of the way
the road was bordered with woods, although occasionally
there was a clearing and, now and then,
a small farm. The road wound and turned up
hill and down and the horses kept at an even trot.
The more adventurous spirits on top of the
coaches cheered and shouted and sang, but Sam’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
companions inside were more subdued. He sat
next a small boy of perhaps thirteen, who looked
rather depressed and homesick. Sam tried conversation
with him, but it was not a success.
After a half-hour or so a louder cheer than usual
came from outside, and Sam, looking ahead, saw
a blue, sun-lit lake below them, lying in the green
bowl of the wooded hills. Then it was lost to
sight again and they began the descent, the brakes
scraping hard against the big wheels as the coach
swayed and bumped. Five minutes later they
had arrived.</p>

<p>Sam descended before a large many-windowed
wooden building, hardly more than a shed in appearance.
A wide uncovered porch ran across the
front of it. The building was so new that only the
roof had weathered. Beyond it was a second of
similar size and appearance, and beyond that,
again, on slightly higher ground, was a smaller
structure. The buildings faced the lake, the shore
of which was some fifty yards distant. Behind
the clearing the forest of birch and maples and
oaks, with an occasional pine or hemlock, gave
enticing glimpses of shadowed paths, but about
the camp were few trees left standing, and of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
these, one had been shorn of its branches and
bore, floating lazily from its tip, a white flag with
a blue pyramid, doubtless intended to represent
an Indian wigwam. There was little breeze to-day
and the sun beat down hotly, and Sam looked
longingly into the dim recess seen beyond the
wide, open door of the nearer building.</p>

<p>With the arrival of the foremost stage three
men came down the steps. One was a short,
stocky gentleman, brisk and alert, who wore
knickerbockers and golf stockings and a soft white
shirt, and whose round face seemed at first glance
to be all brown Vandyke beard and rubber-rimmed
Mandarin spectacles. He was followed by two
younger men, one not much more than a boy and
the other somewhere about thirty. Unlike the
older man, they each wore camp costume; flannel
trousers belted over a blue sleeveless shirt, and
brown “sneakers.” It was the short man in
knickerbockers who now took command. One by
one, the arrivals were shaken by the hand and
passed on to the older of the two councillors, who,
in turn, directed them to one or the other of the
larger buildings. The short man knew many of the
boys by name and greeted them warmly, and these,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
addressing him as “Chief,” seemed equally
pleased at the meeting. If he did not know the
name of a boy, he asked it and, on being told,
said briskly, “Oh, yes! Well, Jones, I’m glad
to know you. Mr. Haskins, this is Jones. Just
look after him, please.” And so Jones or Smith,
or whatever his name might be, shook hands again
and was finally sent trudging on into one or the
other of the dormitories.</p>

<p>Sam stood aside and waited until the boys had
been distributed. Then, formulating a little
speech of introduction, he moved toward where
the short man and the man with the coloured hat-band
were shaking hands. But his speech was
not required. <a href="#i_036fp">“Well, Craig, so you found us,
eh?” asked the short man, with a smile and a firm
clasp of the hand.</a> “Very glad to see you. My
name is Langham. Mr. Gifford I suppose you
know.”</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 401px;">
<a id="i_036fp">
  <img src="images/i_036fp.jpg" width="401" height="600" alt="" title="" />
</a><br />
<div class="caption"><a href="#Page_36">“Well, Craig, so you found us, eh?” asked the
short man, with a smile and a firm clasp of the hand</a></div>
</div>

<p>The man with the coloured hat-band explained,
however, that they had not met. “I saw you at the
station,” he said, “but I wasn’t sure that you
were one of us. Very stupid of me. Well, let’s
go and get into some comfortable togs. I suppose
Craig is in The Tepee, Chief?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes. If Haskins is there, ask him to come out
and show the men about the trunks, please. By
the way, I thought we’d better get them into the
water about four.”</p>

<p>Sam was surprised until he realized that
“them” meant the boys and not the trunks. He
followed Mr. Gifford to the further dormitory,
climbed a flight of four steps, crossed the unroofed
porch, and entered through a wide doorway.
For a moment the sudden change from the
sunlight to the dimmer light inside confused him.
Presently, though, he was examining his new home
with interest.</p>

<p>The building was of a width that accommodated
two rows of cots, one at each side, and left a
wide passage between. At the farther end of the
passage a second door stood wide open, framing
a picture of green leaves in shadow and sunlight.
On each side of the long room were many square
openings, which did duty as windows. They were
not sashed, but were provided with wooden shutters
which opened inward and hooked back
against the walls. In all the time that Sam was
there the shutters were closed but once, and then
only on one side of the dormitory. There were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
twelve cots in one row and eight in the other.
Midway on the side holding the fewer cots was a
big rough-stone fireplace, and in front of it a
table and chairs. At the foot of each cot was a
shallow closet with hooks for garments below and
some shelves above. Three large kerosene lamps
hung from the roof.</p>

<p>Sam’s cot was the first one inside the door on
the left. Mr. Gifford’s was opposite. At the head
of each was a small stand holding a hand-lamp, and
Mr. Gifford explained that the councillors were
permitted to keep these burning after the dormitory
lights were out. Sam followed the example
of Mr. Gifford and the boys and changed into
camp uniform, stowing the rest of his belongings
in the tiny closet. Many of the youngsters were
already scampering about in their new costumes.</p>

<p>“The Chief tells me you’re going to help me
with athletics,” said Mr. Gifford from across the
passage as he dragged on a pair of faded grey
flannel trousers. “What’s your line?”</p>

<p>“Line?” asked Sam.</p>

<p>“I mean what do you go in for principally?”</p>

<p>“Oh! Baseball principally.”</p>

<p>“That’s good. We play a good deal of it. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
fellows seem to get more fun out of it than anything
else, except, maybe, swimming. You swim,
of course?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Well, we’ll have a talk this evening and map
things out. Now, if you’re ready, we’ll go out and
have a look around, and see what’s to be done.
There’s usually a good deal to attend to the first
day.”</p>

<p>Satisfying himself that their assistance was not
needed in the distribution of trunks, Mr. Gifford
took Sam about the camp. They looked in at the
other dormitory, known as The Wigwam, which
was not materially different from The Tepee; and
then visited the third building.</p>

<p>“This,” said Mr. Gifford, “is the dining-hall.
The fellows call it the Grubbery. There are four
tables, you see. The Chief sits at the head of
this one and the rest of us fellows take the others.
That doesn’t leave one for you, though, does it?
Guess the Chief will put you at the foot of his.
The fellows take turns at setting the tables and
clearing them. We have a splendid cook and
plenty of good things to eat. You won’t go hungry,
Craig. Speaking of that——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Gifford led the way across the hall and
through a swinging door into a kitchen. Sam
followed and was introduced to the cook, one Cady
Betts, a tall, fair-complexioned French-Canadian
whom the boys, as Sam discovered later, called
“Kitty-Bett.”</p>

<p>“Cady,” said Mr. Gifford, “we’re starved. Got
anything to eat?”</p>

<p>The cook, who had been stocking the shelves
with the supplies which had reached camp a little
while before, smiled doubtfully.</p>

<p>“There is nothing cook,” he said in his careful
English, “but there is crackers and cheeses.
Maybe you like them?”</p>

<p>Mr. Gifford declared that he did and, assisted
moderately by Sam, consumed a large quantity
of each, sitting on the kitchen table and chatting
the while with “Kitty-Bett.” The latter, Sam
learned by listening, came from Michigan and in
winter cooked for a big lumber company. He had
a pair of the mildest, softest blue eyes Sam had
ever seen in a man, and a pleasant smile, but one
had only to watch him handle the cans and bags
and jugs for a minute to see that he was as deft
and quick as he was amiable. Presently Mr. Gifford<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
conducted Sam back through the dining-hall
again, pointing out the mail box which hung just
inside the doorway. All the doors at the camp
were double and swung outward, and, as Sam
found in the course of time, were seldom ever
closed. Eating in the dining-hall was much like
eating out of doors, for, besides the big doorway
and a shuttered opening at the front, the two
sides of the building from three feet above the
floor to the eaves opened out and up, admitting
light and air and, it must be confessed, not a
few flies!</p>

<p>There was an ice-house behind the kitchen, with
a storage space in front for meats and eggs and
milk and vegetables, a place whose temperature
was most grateful after the warmth outside.
From there they walked down to the landing.
Here lay quite a flotilla of row-boats and canoes,
which a tow-headed youth named Jerry—if he
had another name Sam never learned it—was engaged
in painting and varnishing. Jerry was a
sort of general factotum; carried the mail across
the lake once a day in the little naphtha launch,
which had not yet been slid out of the small
boat-house nearby, washed dishes after meals,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
pared potatoes, ran errands, and performed a
dozen other duties. Mr. Gifford shook hands with
Jerry and formally presented Sam. Jerry observed,
with a shy smile, that he was “pleased to
meet you, sir.”</p>

<p>On the float, which was quite large, there was
a springboard and a slide; also a covered box
which held oars and oar-locks and canoe paddles,
and had a life-belt hung at one end. There was
not much of a beach there, for shore and lake met
sharply. There was, however, Mr. Gifford explained,
a fairly good stretch of sand further
along, near the ball-field, which the older boys
were allowed to go in from occasionally.</p>

<p>“About the first thing a boy has to do when
he gets here,” said Mr. Gifford, “is learn to
swim. We put them all into the water twice a
day, and those who want to may duck before
breakfast. It generally takes only about a month
to get the most backward youngsters to a point
where they can keep afloat. They usually do their
best to learn quickly because we don’t allow them
in the boats until they have; and it seems to be
every boy’s ambition to spend half his life in a
canoe! I suppose you can manage a boat, Craig?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>“I can row a little; not very well, I guess. I’ve
never been in a canoe, though.”</p>

<p>“We’ll have to remedy that. It won’t take you
long to learn. Well, I guess we’ve seen about all
there is. What do you think of the place?”</p>

<p>“It’s very—interesting,” replied Sam. “I
never was at a camp before.”</p>

<p>“Really?” Mr. Gifford was silent for a minute
or two while they walked back toward the dormitories.
Then: “If you don’t mind my asking,
Craig, how old are you?” he inquired.</p>

<p>Sam told him and he nodded. “You look older
than that,” he said. “Better let the boys think
you are older. They’ll mind you better, I guess.
You haven’t met Haskins and Brown yet, have
you? Let’s find them.”</p>

<p>They were with Mr. Langham in the little partitioned-off
room at the front of The Wigwam,
which the Director used both as office and bedroom.
Mr. Haskins was, next to the Director, the
oldest of the five who, with the arrival of Mr.
Gifford and Sam, crowded the small office to its
capacity. He was rather serious-looking, wore
thick-lensed glasses and was slightly bald. He
was an instructor at Burton College, which institution<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
was well represented at The Wigwam, since
Mr. Langham, too, was a member of the Burton
faculty and Mr. Gifford was a post-graduate student
there. Young Brown, a merry-faced boy of
twenty, and Sam were the only ones not connected
with Burton. Steve Brown was a sophomore at
Western Reserve, and, like Sam, was a newcomer
at the camp. After introductions were over Mr.
Langham went over the daily schedule with the
others—Sam found that his official title was junior
councillor—and explained their duties. It seemed
to Sam that The Wigwam was to be a very busy
place and that time was not at all likely to hang
heavily on his hands!</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV</a><br />
<small>THE BLANKET THAT RAN AWAY</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Two days later The Wigwam was running
according to schedule. The rising bugle sounded
at seven and breakfast was at half-past. From
the time breakfast was over until nine there was
work of some sort for all hands. Beds had to
be made, dormitories swept and put in order,
grounds “policed,” lamps filled, wood piled for
the evening’s “camp-fire” and numerous other
duties attended to. From nine to eleven the boys
did as they liked. A few were being coached in
studies by Mr. Haskins and Mr. Gifford, and such
work came in the forenoon. Then, too, Steve
Brown conducted a class in photography which
was well patronised, and once a week Mr. Langham
took those who wanted to go for a walk
through the woods or along the lake for Nature
Study. At eleven there was what the boys called
“soak.” Wearing bathing trunks, the boys lined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
up on the edge of the float and at the word from
one of the councillors plunged into the water.
Those who could not swim did their “plunging”
from the sides of the float where the water was
only a couple of feet deep. “Soak” lasted the
better part of an hour and all the councillors were
on hand in bathing suits to give instruction and
prevent accidents. It was the duty of one to sit
in a row-boat a little ways off shore and go to
the assistance of any bather in difficulties. In fine
weather that morning bath was the most enjoyable
hour of the day. There were thirty-eight
boys at the camp, and when they all got to splashing
around and skylarking there was much fun
and merriment. Woe to any of them who stood
unguardedly near the edge of the float, for someone
was certain to sneak up behind and then
there’d be a howl and a splash and a chorus of
laughter as the victim came thrashing to the surface.
And, of course, there were always upsets on
the springboard, and some boy was forever discovering
a new and ridiculous manner of going
down the slide. The councillors interfered very
little, and, although real hazing was put down with
a firm hand, the youngsters had to stand a good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
deal of ungentle handling which did them no
harm and speedily taught them confidence.</p>

<p>Sam quickly proved himself the best swimmer
at camp and to him was delegated the education of
the more advanced pupils, a task which he thoroughly
enjoyed and went into heart and soul.
There were some eight or ten older boys who
showed real ability, and one, Tom Crossbush, a
youth of nearly sixteen years, who, before the
summer was over, learned to duplicate nearly
every feat of Sam’s, whether of diving or swimming.</p>

<p>Dinner was at half-past twelve, and, following
it, came thirty minutes of siesta when every occupant
of the camp, barring Kitty-Bett and Jerry,
the chore-boy, was required to lie on his bed and
keep absolutely quiet. The boys corrupted the
word to “sister” and, most of them, thoroughly
disliked that period. At two o’clock came recreation
until four-thirty. There were two fairly good
tennis courts and a ball-field about a quarter of
a mile from camp. There, too, were set up standards
for jumping and vaulting, and there was a
ring for shot-putting and a stretch of fairly
smooth turf used for sprinting. The boys were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
all required to take up some form of athletic endeavour
and those two hours and a half from two
to four-thirty constituted the busiest period of the
day for Mr. Gifford, Steve Brown, and Sam. Steve
instructed in tennis—he was a good player—and
helped at anything else he could. Mr. Gifford presided
over track and field athletics and Sam was
given entire charge of baseball. With very few exceptions
all the boys played ball or tried to. Three
nines were formed, the members drawn by lot by
Mr. Gifford, Steve, and Sam, each of whom acted as
manager for his aggregation. Captains were then
chosen and practice began. Regular games were
played twice a week, on Wednesdays and Saturdays,
and by the end of a fortnight the keenest
rivalry had developed and they were having some
exciting, if not very scientific contests.</p>

<p>The afternoon bathe, or “plunge,” as it was
called, came at half-past four and was over at
five. Supper was at five-thirty. The camp-fire
was lighted at eight and boys and councillors
gathered about it to talk over together the day’s
happenings, make plans for the morrow and tell
stories, sing songs and, finally, say prayers, and
retire to the dormitories at nine. At ten o’clock<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
the big lights were put out and after that quiet
was supposed to prevail. Sometimes it didn’t,
however, for all sorts of jokes were played in the
darkness and quite frequently the councillors, at
the end of the hall, would hear stealthy footsteps,
muffled laughter, the sound of struggles and, sometimes,
the crash of a cot whose wooden legs had
been surreptitiously reversed beforehand and now
deftly folded up underneath by the aid of a cord
pulled, perhaps, from far down the hall. Sam was
surprised to find that these larks were seldom
interfered with by Mr. Gifford. If too much
“rough-house” resulted the latter sent a cautioning,
“That will do, fellows! Cut it out now!”
travelling through the darkness and the usual
result was instant quiet. “All the fun you like
so long as it’s harmless” was the rule at The
Wigwam.</p>

<p>Being a newcomer, Sam had to undergo some
initiating. The second night he was there, after
he had settled himself comfortably on his straw
mattress and was drowsily watching the stars
through the window at the foot of his cot, something
at once startling and mysterious occurred.
If Sam had been more experienced with boys he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
would have become suspicious at the almost instant
silence which prevailed that night after
“lights.” Almost before the boys had exchanged
“good night” with the councillors, unmistakable
evidences of healthy slumber came from various
quarters. Something else that might have warned
Sam was the prompt dousing of his reading-light
by Mr. Gifford. The previous night that gentleman
had burned his lamp until almost midnight,
as Sam, the unaccustomed surroundings and the
strange bed keeping him wakeful, well knew. But
to-night Mr. Gifford had blown out his lamp only
a minute or so after ten.</p>

<p>Sam was just on the verge of sinking off into
slumber when the blanket—there were no sheets
at The Wigwam—suddenly slid off to the floor.
Sleepily, he reached down and felt for it, but
failed to get hold of it. Wider awake now, he
groped again but with no success. There was
enough light from the open doorway and the windows
to show him the blanket lying under the next
cot. Blinking, he put his legs out of bed and
reached for it. It wasn’t there! He stared in
amazement. He stooped and peered under the
cot. The blanket was now between it and the next<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
one. Still too bemused by sleep to suspect a
trick, he got up and walked around to the next
aisle. The snoring had quite ceased, but Sam
failed to notice the fact. Again he leaned down
to pick up the blanket and again it wasn’t there!</p>

<p>He realised then he was the victim of a practical
joke, but the mechanism still puzzled him. Up
and down the dormitory not a figure moved. Intense
silence prevailed. With the breeze playing
about his bare legs, Sam stood in the passage and
deliberated. Finally a slow smile spread over his
face and the next instant he had whisked the
blanket from the nearest cot and was walking sedately
back to his bed! And at that moment
shouts went up from all over the dormitory and
every boy was sitting up in his cot, wide awake
and swaying with laughter. And, as Sam lay
down again and drew his stolen blanket over him,
he was surprised to hear Mr. Gifford’s laughter
mingling heartily with the rest!</p>

<p>The boy whose bed-clothing Sam had taken in
reprisal was now dodging from one aisle to the
next in wild pursuit of the elusive blanket which,
pulled at the end of a cord from the farther end
of the hall, led him a merry chase. Meanwhile<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
the boys were calling demurely to Sam: “Cold
night, Mr. Craig!” “Anything I can do, sir?”
“That was a mean trick, Mr. Craig!” And then
Mr. Gifford’s voice from across the passage: “We
all have to take it, Craig! All right now?”</p>

<p>“Yes, thanks,” replied Sam. “Anyone who
gets this will have to fight for it!”</p>

<p>At which there was more laughter and some
applause and at last the dormitory really settled
down to slumber and the snores that Sam heard
were not feigned. Sam chuckled once or twice
before he too dropped off to sleep.</p>

<p>A day or so later he was given an involuntary
bath. He was standing on the end of the landing
watching Horace Chase try to do the Australian
crawl-stroke, when there was a sudden push from
behind and in he went, heels over head, and for
a moment he and young Chase were inextricably
mixed up, for he had landed squarely on that
youth. When he came to the surface, sputtering
and blinking, he supposed that it had been an
accident, but the grinning faces of the boys on
the landing told a different tale, as did the smile
that played over the countenance of Mr. Haskins,
who was on duty in the row-boat. Then Sam<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
grinned too, pulled himself quickly to the landing,
and charged the miscreants. Over they went, with
shouts and squeals, striking the water every which
way and for the next few minutes giving Sam a
wide berth. His good-natured acceptance of their
jokes won their approval, and, although some few
boys at first rather resented being under the
authority of a fellow who was only a year or two
older than they were, Sam soon found that he had
won his place.</p>

<p>Every forenoon at ten o’clock the councillors
met in Mr. Langham’s little office and made their
reports and talked over with the Chief all matters
concerning the conduct of the camp. Now and
then, at first very infrequently, it was necessary
to discipline some too-spirited youth. But on the
whole the boys were well-behaved and little punishment
had to be meted out. Usually the council
ended in a jovial give-and-take in which even the
Chief had to accept his share of joking. Sam
found himself a bit too slow at repartee to take
much part in these exchanges of banter, but he
enjoyed them in his quiet way and was perhaps
better liked because he bore himself modestly.</p>

<p>He had plenty to keep him busy, but all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
tasks were more like play than work, and the
fact that he was out of doors practically every
moment of each day, and might as well have been
outdoors at night as far as fresh air was concerned,
made his duties easy, kept him fit and gave
him a most voracious appetite of which he was
inclined to be ashamed until he saw that it was
no more remarkable than Steve Brown’s or Mr.
Gifford’s, or, for that matter, some of the boys
themselves! Things certainly tasted good, too.
The food was plain but plentiful, and well-cooked.
Kitty-Bett disdained coal, and the meats had a
wonderful wood-fire flavour that appealed to appetites
grown out-o’-doors. Blueberries were in
season and wild raspberries were to be had for
the picking. Fresh vegetables were brought
every day from a neighbouring farm. There was
hot meat at noon—steak or roasts—and cold meat
for supper. The eggs were freshly-laid, and,
whether boiled or made into one of Kitty-Bett’s
inimitable omelets, were delicious. And as for
Kitty-Bett’s pies and doughnuts and griddle-cakes!
Well, words would have quite failed Sam
there! The doughnuts—Kitty-Bett called them
“fried-cakes”—were in such demand that he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
to fry a batch almost every day. Between meals
there was always a bowl of them on one of the
tables in dining-hall, and there was no one to see
whether you took one or a half-dozen.</p>

<p>Fortunately, for a whole two weeks the weather
was fair; pretty hot in the middle of the day,
but cool enough at night to make at least one
thickness of blanket acceptable. Life at The
Wigwam was very pleasant, and to this effect Sam
wrote home to his mother and sister, and, later,
to Tom Pollock. Sam felt very grateful to Tom
for having told him of the situation, and said so
in the letter which he penned one Sunday afternoon,
seated under the trees by the shore of the
lake. Among other things, Sam wrote: “You
were right about the railway fare. Mr. Langham
asked me how much it was and he is going to pay
it back to me at the end of the month. I told
him he needn’t, but he said it was the custom and
everybody got his travelling expenses, even Kitty-Bett,
who is the cook and a wonder. I just wish,
Tom, you could taste some of his blueberry pie.
The shirts you sold me are fine, but I haven’t
worn the sweater yet. The weather has been very
warm and no rain yet. Have you started the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
nine again? Please write and tell me the
news.”</p>

<p>Tom replied very promptly and told all the
happenings. The Blues were getting together
again and Buster Healey was to catch for them.
Sid was to play first base. They hadn’t arranged
for many games yet, but Lynton had promised to
play them a week from next Saturday. Tom was
glad Sam liked the camp, and he and Sid meant
to run up some time in August and see it.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Sam learned to handle a pair of oars
with skill and a canoe paddle less dexterously.
There were fish in the lake and Sam was a devoted
disciple of Walton. His usual companion on his
fishing trips was Tom Crossbush. Tom pretended
to be enthusiastic about the sport, but I think his
liking for Sam was the real reason for his participation
in the excursions down the lake. At all
events, his enthusiasm soon wore off after his
line was dropped and most of the fish that were
caught came up on Sam’s hook. Once or twice
Steve Brown went along, but Steve didn’t pretend
to know much about the gentle art and as often
as not sat for long stretches with, as he said,
“nothing on his hook but water.” Nevertheless,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
it was Steve who, later on in August, by some
miracle hauled in the biggest black bass in the
history of the camp. It weighed just four pounds
and six ounces and Steve was so delighted that
he sent it away to be mounted. Mr. Langham,
who, could he have done so, would have been on
the lake every day holding a bass rod, threw up
his hands in disgust when he saw Steve’s capture.
“Beginner’s luck!” he grumbled. “I’ve fished in
that lake twenty times and never got better than
a two-pounder! What bait did you have?”</p>

<p>“Just a worm, sir,” answered Steve innocently.</p>

<p>“A worm! You mean an angle-worm?” sputtered
the Chief.</p>

<p>Steve assented, and Sam, laughing, said: “He
won’t use hellgamites, Chief. He says they’re too
ugly!”</p>

<p>“A garden worm!” exclaimed Mr. Langham.
“Great jumping Jupiter! Don’t you know you
don’t catch bass with angle-worms, you ignoramus?”</p>

<p>“Sorry,” replied Steve, grinning. “I caught
this one that way, though.”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t boast of it, then,” grunted the
Chief. “You insulted the fish’s intelligence!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
Four pounds and six ounces!” Mr. Langham subsided,
shaking his head and viewing the fish
enviously.</p>

<p>Bass didn’t always bite, however, and perch
were the usual catch. But four or five fair-sized
perch make a palatable addition to the supper or
breakfast menu, and the Chief’s table, at the lower
end of which Sam had his place, was not infrequently
graced with it.</p>

<p>Once every week there was a picnic, and on those
occasions Sam’s prowess with hook and line was
in demand. Sad to relate, however, it was at such
times that his luck failed him, and very seldom
did the picnickers’ vision of crisply fried perch
materialise. That fact never spoiled the fun,
though, and the weekly picnic was a favourite
event. The boys piled into row-boats and canoes,
after the small launch had been filled, and, at the
end of tow-lines, were taken up or down or across
Indian Lake to one of the numerous sites. Fellows
who could be thoroughly trusted in canoes were
allowed to paddle, but most of them floated along
in the wake of the little launch which, with half a
dozen boats holding her back, barely managed to
make six miles an hour. Sam suspected that one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
reason picnics were so popular was because there
was no “sister” on such days. To be sure, after
luncheon was eaten, a luncheon skilfully prepared
by Kitty-Bett, the boys were supposed to lie down
and keep quiet for the usual half-hour, but the
rule was not rigidly enforced and the boys found
many ways of amusing themselves without actually
moving around. By half-past two they
were generally back at the playing-field, for even
a picnic doesn’t take the place of a ball game!</p>

<p>Sam’s team was called the Mascots, Mr.
Gifford’s the Indians, and Steve Brown’s the
Brownies. The councillors sometimes played, but
more often confined themselves to coaching. If
they did take a hand in a game they went into
the outfield so that the boys might play in the
coveted infield positions. Mr. Gifford’s team
was showing up best at the end of the first fortnight
and had won two games. Sam’s charges
had won one and lost one and the Brownies had
lost both of their contests. In fairness to the last
named nines, though, it should be explained that
the Indians were fortunate in the possession of
the only first-class pitcher in camp, one George
Porter, a slight, wiry chap of fifteen who had a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
good curve and a fast straight ball and could mix
them up cunningly. Even Sam, who was considered
a very dependable batsman back in Amesville,
had more than once failed to hit young Porter
safely. Aside from pitchers, however, the
three teams were evenly matched and when, the
Saturday following the receipt of Tom Pollock’s
letter, the Mascots and the Indians met for their
third game, the entire camp was moved to a high
pitch of excitement.</p>

<small>A SLIDE TO THE PLATE</small></h2>
</div>


<p>The minute “sister” was over the boys were
hurrying toward the playing-field, followed more
leisurely by Sam and Mr. Gifford and Steve
Brown, who was to umpire the contest. The way
led through the woods for nearly a quarter of a
mile, over a well-worn path that now skirted the
lake, and now turned inland to cross a brook by a
log bridge. Then it climbed up-hill through a
plantation of young maples, hugged the face of a
limestone boulder and dipped again to the edge
of the field. The whole camp turned out, if we
omit Mr. Langham, Kitty-Bett, and Jerry; and
Mr. Langham arrived later. Sam and Mr. Gifford
set their teams to warming up and the fellows who
were to play the parts of spectators arranged
themselves along the base-lines. It was fairly
hot this afternoon and scarcely a ripple stirred the
surface of the lake. The Indians won the toss and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
went into the field and Steve Brown called: “Play
ball!”</p>

<p>George Porter disposed of the first three Mascots
handily. Tom Crossbush, who led the batting
list, was the only one of the trio to connect with
the ball and his effort only resulted in an easy
out at first. Dick Barry, who pitched for Sam’s
nine, was a chunky, stub-nosed youth of fourteen
with very little science but a whole big lot of
assurance. Ned Welch caught him, and Ned, a
year older, was a steady chap behind the plate and
handled Dick cleverly. But to-day, as usual, Dick
was touched up pretty frequently. Ed Thursby
began the fun for Mr. Gifford’s tribe with a fly that
Dan Peterson, in left field, misjudged miserably.
Ed got to second and the Indians’ third baseman
bunted him to third and reached first himself when
Dick Barry threw low to Crossbush, who played
the initial sack. The next man fanned and Dick’s
friends in the audience shouted approval. But
Sawyer, the Indian first baseman, found something
he liked and slammed a hit between second
and short and Thursby came home with the first
tally. Another hit a minute later scored a second
run and then a pop fly descended into Dick’s glove<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
and made the second out and before the runner on
third could score a second strike-out was secured
by Dick.</p>

<p>The game ran along at two to nothing until
the first of the third. Then the Mascots managed
to get a run across by a combination of a hit, a
sacrifice fly, and an error by the Indians’ third
baseman. But the Indians came back in their half
with a slugging fest and put two more tallies
across. Neither team was able to do anything in
the fourth or fifth. George Porter ran his strike-out
total up to seven and Dick Barry, while he
only fooled one more Indian, somehow managed to
escape punishment. Steve Brown made a decision
at first that dissatisfied the Mascots, when
Dick suddenly shot the ball across to Tom Crossbush
and apparently nailed Ned Welch a foot off
the bag. But the umpire didn’t see it that way
and, anyhow, the decision made no difference in
the outcome.</p>

<p>In the first of the sixth inning Sam’s team
started off with a rush. Young Fairchild dribbled
a weak bunt along third-base line and the throw
to first went wild. The runner scurried to second
and then, coached frantically to go on, made an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
apparently hopeless attempt to reach third. But
another wild heave saved him. Third baseman
blocked the ball, but not in time to make the out,
and Terry Fairchild, immensely proud of his feat,
sat on the bag and tried to recover his breath and
made derisive remarks to the baseman. Sam instructed
the next batter, Pete Simpson, to try to
bunt, hoping that the ball would be played to
the plate and that Pete would get his base. Naturally,
the runner on third was not supposed
to go home unless the way was clear, for there
were no outs.</p>

<p>Pete had a strike and two balls called on him
before he found anything he thought he could
use to advantage. Then he struck loosely against
a high ball and by good luck sent it rolling along
the first-base path. Pete raced for first and
Pitcher Porter raced for the ball. And, contrary
to instructions from the third-base coach, young
Fairchild, doubtless desiring to still further
glorify himself, sprinted for home. He had about
one chance in twenty of reaching it safely, for
Porter scooped up the ball on the run, turned
swiftly, and threw to the plate. And Jimmy Benson,
astride the platter, caught it waist-high, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
everything should have been lovely for the Indians.
But Terry Fairchild, sprawling on his
back, with both legs kicking in the air, arrived a
fraction of a second after the ball and, since Benson
was in the way, Terry just naturally collided
with him, knocked his feet from under him, and
went by. Unfortunately, the shock was so disturbing
to the catcher that he inadvertently loosed
his hold on the ball and the ball followed Terry
into the dust. And Steve Brown, who had already
motioned the runner out, reversed his decision,
and Peter Simpson slid to second.</p>

<p>Jimmy Benson was disgruntled, even angry, and
said unkind things to Terry. But Terry, picking
himself up with a swagger and patting the dust
from his scant costume, only grinned exasperatingly
and walked to the bench, there to be hilariously
patted and hugged by his team-mates.
When, however, he glanced toward Sam, expecting
praise, he got a surprise.</p>

<p>“Don’t do that again, Fairchild,” said the
junior councillor severely. “Mind what the coach
tells you. You made it, but you had no business
making it, and if Benson hadn’t dropped the
ball you’d have looked pretty cheap. You take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
your orders from the coach, Fairchild, after
this.”</p>

<p>Terry, chastened in spirit, subsided amidst the
smiles of the others as Jones faced the Indian
pitcher. Porter was in the air now, and, although
Mr. Gifford called encouragement and Benson
counselled him to take his time and “put them
over,” he slammed the ball in vindictively and
Jones drew a pass. Porter steadied down then,
but the team, especially the infield, was unsettled,
and, after Welch, with two strikes against him,
hit squarely to first baseman and made the first
out, Simpson and Jones tried a double steal and
got away with it, the Indian shortstop dropping
the throw from the plate. Cheers and jeers rewarded
this event. Benson tried to steady the
team as Dick Barry went to bat.</p>

<p>“Never mind that, fellows!” called Jimmy.
“Here’s an easy one! Strike him out, George!
Three will do it! Put ’em right over the middle,
he couldn’t hit a basket-ball!”</p>

<p>Possibly Dick couldn’t have hit a basket-ball, but
he did manage to connect with one of Porter’s
curves and send it just over second baseman’s
head. When the ball was back in the pitcher’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
hands two more runs had crossed the plate, Dick
was safe at first, and the score was a tie at four
runs each. But the Mascots were not through
even then. Sam, realising that now was the time
to win, if ever, urged his fellows to their best
endeavours. Tom Crossbush, however, over-anxious
for a hit, struck at everything and, after
fouling off two good ones, bit at a wide curve,
and retired morosely to the bench.</p>

<p>“Two gone!” announced the coaches. “Run
on anything, Dick!”</p>

<p>So Dick took a chance and scuttled for second
and beat the ball by several feet. Peterson waited
while Porter worked a strike and two balls on
him. Then he met the next offering fairly and
squarely for the longest hit of the game, and sent
it far into centre field, at least a yard over Meldrum’s
head, and while that youth scampered back
for it, raced desperately around the bases in an
attempt to stretch a three-bagger into a home run.
Fortunately, though, he was held up at third, to
score the sixth tally a minute later when Groom’s
easy infield hit got by Thursby at second. Peterson
reached the plate on his stomach, the merest
fraction of an instant ahead of the ball. Then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
White hit a swift one to Thursby, and that youth,
retrieving his previous error, made a flying one-hand
catch for the third out.</p>

<p>But six to four looked good to the Mascots and
they trotted into the field with the determination
to hold their advantage. And they did, for the
rest of the sixth at least. For Dick Barry, summoning
all the craft he knew, and ably seconded
by Ned Welch, disposed of the next two Indians
without trouble. The third banged out a two-bagger
into right, and subsequently stole third
when Welch let a delivery get past him, but he
got no further that inning, for the next batsman
was an easy out, second baseman to first.</p>

<p>There was no scoring in either half of the
seventh, although the Indians had two men on bases
at one time, with only one out. What luck there
was broke for the Mascots; and the first double-play
of the game, participated in by Groom and
Crossbush, put an end to the inning. In the
eighth the Mascots came near to scoring when
Peterson reached third on a base hit and a wild
throw to second and tried to score on White’s
grounder to shortstop. At that the decision at the
plate was close and might have gone either way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>In their half the Indians set to work with vim
and lighted on Dick Barry hard. Codman hit
safely, Benson got his base on balls, Porter struck
out, Thursby sacrificed, and Nettleton, with only
one gone, filled the bases by a pop fly to Dick,
which that overeager youth dropped. Things
looked desperate then for Sam’s charges, but a
minute later Sawyer had fouled out to third baseman
and the Mascots and their allies breathed
freer. They were not to emerge unscathed, however,
for Meldrum hit a bounder that just tipped
Dick’s upstretched fingers and was finally fielded
by Groom too late to throw to the plate or to first,
and the Indians scored their fifth run. Then,
after missing the plate three times out of four,
and putting himself in a hole, Dick made a sudden
throw to second and, after a wildly exciting moment,
the runner was caught between bases.</p>

<p>Simpson opened the ninth for the Mascots with
a bunt that trickled down the first-base line and
threatened every instant to roll out, but never did,
much to the disgust of Porter and Benson, who
hovered anxiously over it. Had Porter fielded
it at once he could have made the assist, but he
left the decision with the ball and the ball fooled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
him. Then Jones sacrificed Peterson to second,
Welch struck out, Barry lifted a fly to left field
that was an easy catch and, with two down and
a runner on second, the inning looked about over.
But Tom Crossbush drew a pass and stole second
on the first pitch, while Simpson went to third,
and then Dan Peterson scored Simpson, with a hit
over second base.</p>

<p>The Mascots leaped and shrieked with delight,
and while the Indians were still wondering what
had happened, and while George Porter was winding
up to send his first offering to Billy White,
Crossbush, who was dancing back and forth a
dozen feet from third, suddenly broke for the
plate. Shouts of warning, shrieks of excitement!
Porter momentarily faltering as he pitched!
Crossbush sliding feet foremost for the platter!
Benson leaping far to the right in a despairing
effort to get the ball! Peterson rounding second
like a runaway colt! And then, while the
brown dust billowed, Steve Brown announcing,
“Safe!”</p>

<p>Eight to five then, and nothing to it but the
Mascots! Shouting and dancing and pandemonium
along the lines! And, finally, White striking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
out and a deep breath of relief from the Indians
and their supporters.</p>

<p>And there practically ended the game, for the
Indians failed to put over a single tally in their
half of the final inning, and ten minutes later the
camp was thronging homeward, the Mascots very
cocky and talkative, and the Indians confiding to
their friends what they would do the next time!</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI</a><br />
<small>THE TILTING MATCH</small></h2>
</div>


<p>The afternoon’s game was talked over by all
hands that evening at camp-fire. Once or twice
the argument grew warm, but it never passed the
bounds of good-nature. Mr. Gifford criticised the
playing, as did Sam and Steve Brown, pointing out
mistakes and making helpful suggestions. Mr.
Gifford had played baseball all during his college
course and knew the game well. Sam, with less
experience, was chary of criticism until urged to
it by the others. When he did give his opinion,
however, it was worth hearing, for he spoke of
several things which had seemingly evaded Mr.
Gifford’s eyes.</p>

<p>“I noticed,” said Sam, “that neither of the outfields
to-day studied the batsman as they should.
They played in the same positions for a right-handed
batter as for a left. Of course, it’s up to
the captain or the pitcher to see the outfield as
well as the infield is where it should be, but every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
outfielder ought to realise that a right-handed
batter is going to hit more to the left than a left-handed
batter, and he ought to move over accordingly.
The infield the same way, only, of course,
the infield needn’t change position so much. On
the Mascots, White stood too far back for most
batsmen. He was all right for a long hit to centre,
but he would have lost two out of three hits into
short centre. The—the ideal position for any
fielder is where he can run in quickly for short
flies and grounders and run out easily for long
ones. Of course no outfielder can station himself
where he is going to be able to reach every ball. If
he gets so far back that he can handle three-baggers
and homers he is going to miss short hits.
But you want to remember that it is a heap easier
to run in for a ball than it is to run out, because
when you’re running in you can judge the ball
as you go, and when you’re running out you have
got to make up your mind about where the ball is
coming down and then turn your back and scoot.
The only way to judge the ball is to look over your
shoulder, and that isn’t easy. So the best thing
for an outfielder to do is to play his position about
two-thirds back. That is, leave two-thirds of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
territory in front of him and one-third behind him.
And an outfielder’s territory begins at a point
where it’s impossible for an infielder to reach a
fly and extends to the farthest limits of a home
run. If your infielders are smart at running back
and getting flies, your territory is—is shortened
just so much, and you can play further out than
you can if your basemen and shortstop are weak
on hits outside the diamond. I don’t know that
I’ve explained this very clearly.”</p>

<p>“I think you have,” said Mr. Langham. “Don’t
you, fellows?”</p>

<p>There was a chorus of assent, and Sam continued.</p>

<p>“Another thing was that Peterson played too
far to the right in left field. That fly of Thursby’s
would have been an out if Peterson had been in
position for it. Thursby bats right-handed and
Peterson was playing as though for a left-hander.
Peterson made a fine try for it, but he had to
cover too much ground. So, you see, an outfielder
has got to divide his territory in two ways, lengthwise
and crosswise. Of course, on the big teams
it’s customary for the catcher, or sometimes the
pitcher, to signal to the infield what the delivery<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
is to be and the infielders, usually second baseman
or shortstop, let the outfielders know. Because
a certain kind of a ball, if it is hit, is pretty sure to
go to a certain part of the field, as you all know.”</p>

<p>“That’s something I didn’t know,” laughed the
Chief. “Suppose you explain for my benefit,
Craig.”</p>

<p>“Well, sir, of course I don’t mean that a certain
ball always goes to a certain place when hit,
but it generally does. For instance, if there’s a
right-handed batter up and the pitcher sends him
a slow ball, either in the groove or with an out-curve,
that ball is usually hit before it quite
reaches the plate, because the batter doesn’t judge
the speed of it in time to wait for it, and that hit
goes into third-base territory or beyond. The
same way, if the pitcher sends in a fast ball,
straight or with an out-curve, the batter will hit
late or after the ball has passed the centre of the
plate and it will go toward first base or right field.
A ball of ordinary speed, like a straight drop,
usually goes toward second base. Of course, some
batters can meet a slow ball just right and then
these—these probabilities are upset. But by the—the
law of averages, a slow ball to a right-hander<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
goes to left field and a fast ball to right. And so, if
the fielders know what the pitcher is going to pitch
they can either shift their positions or, anyhow,
be prepared.”</p>

<p>“Doesn’t shifting position give the thing
away?” asked Steve Brown.</p>

<p>“I think it does,” Sam agreed. “But for all
that some of the big teams do it. I don’t think,
though, that it’s necessary. If you’re playing in
the outfield, say, and you get the signal that the
hit is coming to your right, that’s enough. You’re
ready to move that way the instant the ball goes
to the batter.”</p>

<p>“That’s what I suppose you call inside baseball,”
commented Mr. Langham. “It is very interesting.
You must have played a good deal of
baseball, Craig, to know so much about it.”</p>

<p>“I’ve played several years, sir,” replied Sam,
a bit embarrassed. “I’ve always caught, though,
and you have a better chance to study the game
from behind the bat than from anywhere else on
the field, I guess. I—I didn’t mean to talk so
much, though, when I started out.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think you need apologise. I think
we’ve all been very much interested. And I dare<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
say I’m not the only one who has learned something.
How about it, fellows!”</p>

<p>Hearty agreement greeted this, and George Meldrum
said: “I think it would be fine if Mr. Craig
would tell us something like that every evening.
I guess all us fellows want to know about baseball;
I mean stuff like he’s told us to-night. I know
I do.”</p>

<p>“That’s so,” agreed Ned Welch. “How about
another lecture to-morrow, Mr. Craig!”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid that’s what it sounded like, a lecture,”
said Sam ruefully.</p>

<p>“No, I didn’t mean it that way,” replied Ned
earnestly. “We liked it. I always thought that
stuff about a certain kind of a ball going to a certain
part of the field was just—just made up by
men who write about baseball. I didn’t think anyone
could really know beforehand, sir.”</p>

<p>“Let’s try it the next time we play,” said Mr.
Gifford, “and see how it works out. Anyway,
what Mr. Craig has said about shifting positions
according to the batter is excellent advice. And
we’ll see if we can’t persuade him to tell us some
more to-morrow night, fellows. Who plays next
Wednesday, by the way?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>“Your team and the Brownies,” answered
someone. And a discussion of the probable outcome
of that contest followed and almost before
anyone knew it nine o’clock had arrived.</p>

<p>Camp-fire was always a pleasant hour. The
fire was built each morning on a circular floor of
stones some eighty feet up the hill from The
Tepee and just at the edge of the forest. About
it each night the councillors and boys gathered.
At eight the fire was lighted and in its cheery
glare the day’s events were discussed, stories were
told, songs were sung, and plans for the morrow
laid. Several of the boys played instruments.
When the entire orchestra was assembled there
were three mandolins, two banjos, and a violin to
make music. None of the performers save perhaps
Horace Chase was very talented, but all made up
for lack of skill by their willingness to entertain.
Young Chase, who played the violin, was of different
calibre, and when he took his instrument out
of its case the audience was sure of a real treat.</p>

<p>Sam never forgot those nights when, stretched
out on the pine-needles, or, if the evening was
damp, on a blanket from his cot, he lay in the
mellow firelight and listened to Horace Chase<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
play “Annie Laurie” or “Home, Sweet Home.”
He had merrier tunes, but those two seemed to
be the choice of the boys. Or perhaps the mandolins
and banjos would be strumming together, or
fairly near together, some rag-time tune. Or perhaps
the fellows would be singing such songs as
“Solomon Levi” or “Boola” or some more recent
favourite. Often a big white moon swam
overhead or played hide-and-seek amongst the
branches of the dark trees, and the lake, below
them, showed a wonderful silvery path to the
farthest shore. They were very pleasant, those
camp-fire hours; fragrant with the night odours
of trees and grass and pungent pine-needles, musical
with the lap of the water against the shore and
the whisper of the breeze amidst the trees and the
sleepy chirp of unseen birds; blessed, too, with a
fine atmosphere of good-comradeship; nights to
be long remembered.</p>

<p>Sam did continue his baseball talks, although he
didn’t give one every evening, and the boys liked
them and always demanded more. Not all of
Sam’s knowledge had been gained at first-hand,
you may be sure. Much of it he had read or been
told, but all of it he had seen put to the test.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
And, before the summer was over, much of it was
put to the test again, for the fellows profited by
what they heard and, as far as it was possible
in the circumstances, followed Sam’s advice.</p>

<p>Some amusing incidents developed. As, on the
Wednesday following Sam’s first talk, when, in
the game between the Indians and Brownies,
Jimmy Benson signalled for a fast ball and the
fielders, getting the signal from Jimmy, moved
to the left, and the batter lined a hot one six
feet inside of third base, and there was no one
there to even knock it down! But the incident
didn’t prove Sam’s theory at fault, since Jimmy
and Porter both acknowledged afterwards that the
ball had not been what the signal called for, but a
slow out-shoot. It had been a case of mixed signals
between catcher and pitcher. Again, in a
later contest between the same teams, the Brownies,
who had fixed up a most elaborate system of
signals, had a runner on third and one on second.
With two gone, a double steal was called for. The
boy on second got the signal, but the runner on
third was evidently day-dreaming, and a moment
later the surprising sight of two runners each
claiming third base was in evidence! That bungle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
probably cost the Brownies the game and for some
time a signal code was viewed by them with disfavour.</p>

<p>But baseball was not the only interest at The
Wigwam. The first week in August there was
an afternoon of water sports that provided lots
of fun and not a little excitement. By that time
many of the beginners had attained to quite a
degree of proficiency, and in the forty-yard swimming
race more than twenty younger boys lined up
and struggled gallantly for the honours. What a
splashing and gurgling and general rumpus there
was! Mr. Langham laughingly said that it reminded
him of a swarm of minnows trying to get
away from a pickerel!</p>

<p>Harry Codman, a sturdy thirteen-year-old
youth, won by a scant yard over Billy White, and
after that most of the others floundered across the
finish in a bunch and none of the judges could have
told who was entitled to third place. A twelve-year-old
chap named Walters very nearly made
a tragedy of the event. Walters tired himself so
in the first dash that when, halfway through the
race, one of the other swimmers accidentally
kicked him in the stomach, Walters lost all interest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
in the race and tried hard to drown in three
feet of water. It was Sam who saw what had
happened and dropped from the landing and
pulled a much-exhausted and water-logged youth
to dry land. The programme was halted while
young Walters restored some of the water he had
swallowed.</p>

<p>There were many entries for the tilting tournament.
The contestants occupied canoes and were
armed with ten-foot poles. The poles held a pad
at one end and the bows of the canoes were likewise
protected. The boys “had at” each other
most briskly until some fortunate thrust deposited
one or other of the tilters either in the bottom of
his canoe or in the water. Joe Groom emerged
triumphant from three encounters and finally met
George Porter in the final bout. Cheered by the
onlookers, the boys approached each other warily.
Each canoe was paddled by a partner in the stern,
Ned Welch for Joe and Ralph Murdock for George.
Naturally, a good deal depended on the cleverness
of the paddler in manœuvring the canoe and each
of the operators was well skilled. Joe and George,
poles ready, stood in the bows while the craft
neared each other cautiously and the audience<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
laughed and jeered. Then Ned Welch dug his
paddle and his canoe shot forward.</p>

<p>But George and his mate were ready. Their
craft sheered aside, avoiding the bow of the other,
and George, thrusting low, almost won the event
there and then. Fortunately for Joe, however, the
padded pole glanced off his leg and he recovered
his balance but not in time to retaliate. The
canoes swept past each other, turned and again
drew together. This time they met bows on and a
fast and furious battle ensued. Once George went
reeling backward and his canoe rocked dangerously,
but steady work by Murdock avoided an
upset. Ned Welch, pressing the advantage,
pushed after the retreating craft, and Joe sought
to get under the guard of his opponent. George,
though, recovered finely and defended himself so
well that in a moment he was again forcing the
fighting and only a well-executed retreat by Ned
saved Joe from defeat. Ned backed away quickly,
turning almost in the length of the canoe, and before
Murdock could solve his intention, had drawn
parallel and slightly to the rear. Murdock paddled
furiously and shot his craft ahead, but Ned
was on his heels and the spectacle of the two warriors,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
each maintaining his equilibrium with difficulty,
proceeding frantically out into the lake almost
side by side brought bursts of laughter from
the onlookers.</p>

<p>It was a stern chase for a minute and then Ned’s
muscles prevailed and Joe drew up within pole’s
length of his enemy. George, facing toward the
stern of his rocking canoe, strove to beat down
the thrust that Joe made. But Joe’s aim was good
and he put all his force into the delivery and the
padded end of his pole caught George under one
shoulder and fairly lifted him off his feet. Over
he went, backward, still grasping his pole, and
disappeared from sight, while a shout of applause
and laughter arose from the landing and boats, a
shout which redoubled an instant later when Joe,
having lost his balance in the desperate thrust,
staggered, tried to save himself, failed finally, and,
dropping his weapon, plunged heels over head in
the lake!</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII</a><br />
<small>SAM OFFERS A SUGGESTION</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Dripping and grinning the two warriors were
pulled into row-boats and taken ashore, where Mr.
Gifford, referee of the tournament, announced the
match a draw.</p>

<p>There was a senior diving contest, won by Tom
Crossbush, and a junior contest for the younger
youths. And there were several other swimming
races of varying distances. And, finally, a special
race of an eighth of a mile, more or less, between
Sam and Steve Brown, in which Sam allowed his
competitor something like fifty yards and beat
him out handily.</p>

<p>There were no prizes given, but Steve Brown
recorded the events and the names of the winners
with a hot poker on a wooden panel and the panel
was hung in The Wigwam.</p>

<p>The ball games went on twice each week and
the Indians, thanks to George Porter’s pitching,
distanced their rivals without much trouble. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
was well into August before the Mascots again
won a victory from Mr. Gifford’s team, having
meanwhile lost four more games to it. The
Brownies were easy picking for both the other
nines, and, in fact, won but two games all the season,
defeating the Mascots once, 12 to 10, and the
Indians, 7 to 4. In the latter game Porter was
suffering, as he later acknowledged, from too
many unripe apples, and his pitching was far
from being up to his standard. Toward the middle
of August there was a noticeable improvement
in the work of all the teams. The fellows batted
better, fielded better, and ran bases better, and,
too, developed not a little team-play. Even the
Brownies had their star performer, that same
Ralph Murdock who had piloted George Porter
through the tilting bouts. Murdock was a born
first baseman and a fine batsman as well, and had
his team-mates possessed half his ability the
Brownies would have been a nine to fear.</p>

<p>The councillors usually played only in practice,
but once or twice, by common agreement, they
took part in a game. When they did the fielders
were busy. Mr. Gifford was the slugging kind of
a batter and in one game drove out three home<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
runs, a double, and a single in five times at bat.
The Indians were playing the Brownies that day,
and Steve Brown, while he did not succeed in
rivalling Mr. Gifford’s batting record, always
managed to reach first and then showed what
could be done by a smart base-runner. He stole
second brazenly, using the fallaway slide to such
purpose that it was a hopeless matter to try and
stop him. Once on second, he had scarcely more
difficulty reaching third and on two occasions he
made barefaced steals to the plate. In one inning
he reached first on a scratch hit and then stole
home before the following batsman had been retired!
The Indians soon got so that they only
half-heartedly attempted to stay him in his delirious
romps around the bases, only Mr. Gifford
daring to dispute his progress. Mr. Gifford
played in centre field and once, having come in
almost to the base-line to field a short fly, he conceived
the idea of catching Steve off third. Steve
was enjoying a twelve-foot lead at the moment,
doubtless considering his chance of getting home
ahead of the ball. Mr. Gifford pegged suddenly to
third baseman and that youth made a perfect
catch. But, contrary to expectation, Steve didn’t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
scuttle back to safety at third. Instead, he dashed
for the plate at top speed. Third baseman heaved
the ball to catcher. Steve turned and doubled
back. Catcher went after him along the base-line.
By that time most of the infield had gathered
about to help retire the annoying Mr. Brown and
there was much shouting and confusion. But it
was evidently not the first time that Steve had
been caught between bases. He ran and ducked
and doubled as coolly and craftily as if he quite
enjoyed it, which he doubtless did. And at last,
just when the shortstop, who had joined the fray,
was on the point of tagging him, Steve spurted
back to third, upsetting two players on the way
and slid into the bag in safety.</p>

<p>Much applause then from the audience of
non-combatants and from the bench where the
Brownies were congregated. Much laughter, too,
and not a little “ragging” of the Indians. Out
near second Mr. Gifford shook a threatening fist
at Steve as the latter arose and patted the dust
from his flannel trousers. Disconsolately and a
bit sheepishly, the Indians returned to their places.
At the plate, Jimmy Benson stooped to pick up
his mask. In the pitcher’s box George Porter, ball<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
in hand, back to the plate, waited for the fielders
to get in position. And at that psychological instant
Steve Brown trotted home!</p>

<p>He didn’t even hurry. There was a shout of
alarm from the third baseman and Porter turned
to see the councillor halfway to the plate. Porter
raised his arm to throw, but there was Benson, intensely
agitated but helpless, struggling with his
mask. And so Steve crossed the home-plate at a
slow lope and turned smilingly toward the bench.
The ball reached the plate a moment later and
rolled against the backstop. The Indians were
not allowed to forget that incident for many days.</p>

<p>In another contest, when Sam was playing left
field for his team and Mr. Gifford was with the
Indians, there was a batting contest that was
worth seeing. Sam was something of a heavy
hitter himself, and he didn’t find George Porter
very difficult. Sam and Mr. Gifford, then, vied
with each other and kept the opposing outfields
very busy indeed. Mr. Gifford got no home runs
that time, but he made a record of two doubles
and three singles, and his doubles might have
gone for triples if the Mascots’ outfielders hadn’t
been playing well back. Sam got one three-bagger,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
a double, and two singles, on the other occasion
popping a foul to first baseman. In the matter of
total bases the two councillors came off even, but
it was claimed by the Mascots that Sam’s triple
had gained him the palm. As far as the game
itself went, the Indians won it easily.</p>

<p>There came a rainy spell in the middle of the
month, that made baseball out of the question
for several days and the boys began to show signs
of fidgeting. There wasn’t much they could do
to work off their surplus animation when it rained.
Not that the rain kept many of them indoors, for
it didn’t; but knocking about in wet boats and
canoes soon palled, tennis was impracticable, and
there seemed to remain no outdoor amusement.
By the fourth day the fellows had begun to get
into mischief in sheer boredom and Mr. Langham
realised that something must be done; that some
outlet must be provided for the stored-up energy.
The councillors talked it over in the office that
morning. The rain still pelted down and the buildings
were damp and cheerless in spite of the fires
that flared all day in the big chimney-places. Sam,
who had put on his raincoat and had his pockets
bulging with bait-box and fishing tackle, hoped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
the conference would soon be over, for he and Tom
Crossbush were going down the lake after bass.
As it turned out, however, there was to be no
fishing for them to-day.</p>

<p>“I suppose,” said Mr. Langham, “we couldn’t
get up any sort of an athletic meet, Brown?”</p>

<p>“No, sir; everything’s flooded at the field. The
pits are mud-holes.”</p>

<p>“Well, we ought to get them busy at something,
fellows. They’ll be getting into trouble if we
don’t. I thought I detected a strong odour of
cigarettes under the window yesterday.”</p>

<p>Mr. Haskins nodded. “Three or four of the
older boys were in the trunk cellar. I—er—I went
down there, but failed to apprehend them.”</p>

<p>The Chief tried not to smile. They all knew
that Mr. Haskins had undoubtedly warned the
boys of his approach and carefully waited until
they had hidden all incriminating evidence before
he had confronted them. Mr. Langham coughed
and looked out the dripping window.</p>

<p>“We mustn’t have smoking, Haskins,” he said
gravely.</p>

<p>“No, sir. If you’d like the names——”</p>

<p>“No, no,” responded the Chief hurriedly. “If<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
there’s no evidence—— What we’ve got to do is
to get them busy so they won’t get into any deviltry.
Anyone got a suggestion?”</p>

<p>Apparently no one had. At least none spoke
for a moment. Then Mr. Gifford said doubtfully:
“We might let them go over to the village for the
afternoon, sir.”</p>

<p>The village lay across and down the lake some
two miles, a tiny hamlet boasting of three or four
stores, a blacksmith shop, and a station, from
which an occasional train rambled away to the
north on an unimportant branch line. Mr. Haskins
smiled.</p>

<p>“There isn’t much for them to do over there,”
he said. “They might buy root-beer and candy
and make themselves sick, but that’s about
all.”</p>

<p>“What we want is something they can go at
hard,” said Mr. Langham, frowning over the
problem. “Something that’ll leave them healthily
tired out.” Another silence followed and then
Sam asked:</p>

<p>“Would it do them any harm to sleep out of
doors, sir?”</p>

<p>“Sleep out of doors? Why, on wet ground, yes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
I presume it would.” He looked questioningly at
Sam.</p>

<p>“I was thinking that we might have a hike,
sir.”</p>

<p>“A hike,” repeated the Chief thoughtfully. “I
don’t know, Craig. You see——”</p>

<p>“That’s what they need, Chief,” said Mr. Gifford.
“What’s your idea, Sam?”</p>

<p>“Well, I thought we might select a place say
five or six miles away, divide the fellows into two
parties and set out with blankets and grub and
see which party could get there first. There might
be some sort of prize or reward. Of course, it
would mean sleeping outdoors——”</p>

<p>“But if the parties started out together it would
just be a race, wouldn’t it?” objected Mr. Gifford.
“Pretty strenuous, I’m afraid, Sam.”</p>

<p>“I thought we could set out different ways, perhaps.
We could see that the fellows didn’t overdo
it. The idea would be to get there first, but in
good condition. That would mean resting along
the way, taking the easiest routes, and so on. It’s
just a suggestion. And I don’t know anything
about the country around here. Maybe it wouldn’t
do.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>“I say,” exclaimed Steve Brown, “isn’t there
a picnic-ground or something of that sort over
at Miles, Chief? Seems to me I remember a big
open building near the railway.”</p>

<p>“Yes, a park they used to hold Chautauquas in.
You mean we could sleep there, eh? Not a bad
idea. In fact, the scheme sounds good. What do
you think?”</p>

<p>“Excellent,” voted Mr. Haskins. “And I’d like
it myself first-rate. My legs certainly need
stretching.”</p>

<p>“We’d have to take blankets and eats, wouldn’t
we?” asked Steve. “And some cooking things,
too, I suppose. Or we might find some place to
feed over there.”</p>

<p>“It would be more fun for the boys if we cooked
our own grub,” said Mr. Gifford. “Let’s do it,
Chief!”</p>

<p>“Well, by Jove, we will! And I’ll go along.
Now let’s figure on rations and luggage.”</p>

<p>And that is how the Marathon Picnic, as the
boys called it, came about. Shortly after dinner—siesta
being disregarded that day—the boys congregated
in The Wigwam and the plan, of which
they had already caught an inkling, was explained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
to them. It met with instant acclaim. Had the
Chief suggested a trip to the North Pole they
would have welcomed it. Mr. Gifford and Sam
alternately selected members for the rival parties
until every boy had a place on the “Reds” or the
“Blues,” as they chose to call them. Mr. Haskins
was finally drawn by Mr. Gifford and Steve Brown
by Sam. Mr. Langham, when they set out, elected
to throw in his lot with the “Reds,” Mr. Gifford’s
party. Every fellow rolled up his blanket, tied
the ends together and slipped it over a shoulder.
Then he donned his raincoat. Food and a few
cooking utensils were apportioned out and went
into pockets or were slung over shoulders, and
a tin cup graced every belt. At half-past two all
was ready for the start.</p>

<small>THE “BLUES” WIN!</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Miles, a small village about four miles distant
from camp in a straight line, was on the opposite
side of Indian Lake. A study of the map
had shown that if the trip was made entirely afoot
the distance was nearly seven miles, whether one
passed around the southern end of the lake or
the northern. Some light advantage appeared to
lie with the northern route, since one could finish
the journey over the railroad track and so save a
possible half-mile. Mr. Gifford and Sam had
tossed a coin for choice of routes and the former
had won and selected the northern way. Almost
on the minute of the half-hour the two parties,
shouting good-bye, set off from in front of The
Wigwam, the “Reds” hiking briskly away toward
the road that led to the Indian Lake station and
the “Blues” skirting the lake to cross the playing-field
and ultimately reach the road which led by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
many turns and angles about the southern or
lower end of the lake.</p>

<p>It had been agreed that after half of the distance
had been covered each party should be
divided into a first and second group, the slower
walkers in the latter, each group in charge of one
of the councillors. This was to keep the weaker
boys from straggling and, possibly, getting lost.
Filled with enthusiasm and a physical energy
generated by three days of inactivity, the “Blues”
set off at a pace which would have left them tired
out before half the distance had been traversed
had Sam allowed them to continue. But once
away from camp he took the lead and made the
fellows suit their pace to his.</p>

<p>“We’ve got seven miles to do, fellows,” he said,
“and maybe more, and the idea is not only to get
there first, but to get there in good condition. If
we overdo it now we’ll suffer later. Three miles
an hour over the roads we’ll have is plenty fast
enough. Some of you could do better than that
and some of you will find it a little too fast. After
a while we’ll divide into two squads and Mr.
Brown will take one and I’ll take the other. Those
of you who feel the pace can take it more slowly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
with the second crowd. If any of you have to
stop you must tell Mr. Brown or me, so you won’t
get left behind. There isn’t any reason why you
should, though, because there’ll be a rest of a few
minutes every half-hour.”</p>

<p>Steve Brown joined Sam, and, turning occasionally
to make sure that none of the nineteen
youths who comprised the squad was straggling,
the two councillors and the boys about them
chatted and laughed and had a very merry time
of it in spite of the steady downpour of rain. The
first half-mile was across country and, toward the
end of it, the going was mostly up-hill. At last,
though, they came suddenly on the road, a narrow
and ever-winding country lane just wide enough
for one vehicle. Fortunately, the soil was mostly
sand and the roadway was consequently fairly dry.
At least, there were few of the puddles and muddy
stretches which they were to encounter later on.
The woods closed in on each side of them, although
occasionally they had a brief view of the
lake, grey and sullen, a half-mile or so below. It
was shortly after reaching the road that Sam
called the first halt after consulting what he called
his “one-jewelled watch.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p>Some of the boys had not yet found their second
wind and were glad to perch themselves for a few
minutes along the side of the road. The weather
was by no means chilly and those whose raincoats
were of rubber found them much too warm, especially
as they also had their blanket-rolls across
back and chest. Several begged to be allowed to
remove their coats, but this neither Sam nor Steve
thought it wise to consent to. A few minutes
past three they went on, some of the older and
stronger fellows inclined to grumble over the slowness
of the pace. The road presently turned
abruptly toward the east and led them out on the
summit of a sparsely-wooded ridge from which
they had a view of the lower end of the lake and
of the country on the other side. On a fair day,
as Steve said, they might have seen the camp very
easily, for they had reached a point nearly halfway
around the end of the lake and much of the
eastern shore was visible. The councillors discussed
the advisability of cutting across near the
lake and trusting to pick up the road again later,
and the boys were much in favour of the plan, but
it was finally decided that, although they might
gain in distance, the more difficult travelling would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
equalise matters and that it would be best to keep
to the highway even though it insisted on fairly
turning its back on their destination.</p>

<p>By the time the next rest was taken some straggling
was already in evidence. Several of the
younger fellows showed a disposition to slow
down, and Sam and Steve decided that at the next
stop the party should be divided into the two
squads as planned. It was then nearly twenty
minutes to four and they judged that they had
covered about three miles and a half, although as
no one had a pedometer save young Chase, and
his was, as he explained, absolutely unreliable,
this estimate was mostly guesswork and, as indicated
later, probably too great by the better part
of a mile. At five minutes past four, they having
then struck fairly westward once more, with, as
they believed, the lower end of the lake well behind
them, another halt was called and Steve
recruited for his rear-guard.</p>

<p>Strangely, however, few of the nineteen would
allow that they were at all tuckered. Horace
Chase and Billy White confessed to blistered
heels, but were all for keeping up with the first
group. The councillors had to take matters into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
their own hands and, using their best judgment,
relegate eight of the nineteen to the rear squad.
Most of the eight objected strenuously. They felt
themselves utterly disgraced. Mutiny was in the
air and the two councillors had to be very stern
and short-spoken before affairs were finally settled.
Then Sam with his eleven started off a bit
more briskly and Steve, waving a laughing good-bye
and threatening to get there first, after all,
held his overeager and disgruntled squad to what
they grumblingly assured him was a snail’s-pace.</p>

<p>There was less talking now in the ranks. Fellows
had found it wise to husband their breath, for
the road had grown muddy and wet and the walking
was harder. The rear squad soon dropped
from sight around a turn and Sam’s party, pushing
forward at a good rate of speed, began to
look for signs of civilisation. But another half-hour
passed, with its accompanying rest—only
two or three minutes this time—before they caught
sight of their first house. It was a deserted cabin
perched on a gravelly hill just off the road. But
even the sight of an empty house was welcome,
since it seemed to promise a settlement, near
at hand. And, a quarter of an hour later,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
the settlement, such as it was, appeared. There
was a country store and half a dozen houses
in it, and Sam called a halt while he entered
the store to make inquiries. Several
of the boys went inside with him, while the
others seated themselves on the edge of the
rickety platform outside to rest.</p>

<p>The only occupant of the store was an elderly
man who hobbled forward with the aid of a hickory
stick. He was very deaf and Sam was forced to
twice repeat his question before the store-keeper
sensed it. Then he grinned a toothless grin and
asked: “On foot, be ye?”</p>

<p>Sam assured him that they were and the old
man shook his head.</p>

<p>“It’s a goodish way to Miles,” he said. “Most
four miles, I guess, by the road.”</p>

<p>“Four miles!” ejaculated Sam. “But, man
alive, we’ve walked at least six and it was supposed
to be only seven when we started.”</p>

<p>“Where’d ye come from?”</p>

<p>“The Wigwam, a boys’ camp on Indian Lake.
It’s about three miles this side of Indian Lake
village.”</p>

<p>“Well, if ye was goin’ to Miles why didn’t ye<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
cross the lake?” inquired the man contemptuously.</p>

<p>“We wanted to walk. Does this road we’re on
now go to Miles?”</p>

<p>“Uh-huh, mostly. It goes to Tappenville, too,
and Lower Millis. If you keep to the right turn
about a mile an’ a half beyond here and then take
the middle branch a ways beyond that ag’in you’ll
likely get to Miles.”</p>

<p>“Is there any shorter way?”</p>

<p>“Well, there is an’ there ain’t. If you go across
that field yonder an’ find Benny James’s place
likely he’ll row ye across to t’other side, an’
then——”</p>

<p>“But we want to walk,” said Sam impatiently.</p>

<p>“Uh-huh; all right. Keep the road then, son.”</p>

<p>“And there’s no short cut?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know as there be. Still, ye might strike
off across the hill when ye reach the first fork.
Likely you’d pick up the road ag’in beyond Lower
Millis.”</p>

<p>“I see.” Sam frowned thoughtfully. Finally,
“I guess we’d better stick to the road,” he
said.</p>

<p>“Uh-huh; I would if I was you, son.”</p>

<p>Rather dejectedly then they took up the journey<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
once more. “I don’t believe the old codger
knows what he’s talking about,” grumbled Tom
Crossbush. “How can it be four miles further
when we’ve walked five or six?”</p>

<p>“Five or six!” said another of the party. “I’ll
bet we’ve walked ten!”</p>

<p>A little further on, the rain, which for the past
hour had been hardly more than a drizzle, stopped
entirely, and off came raincoats. Walking was a
bit easier then. The road went up hill and down
and turned and twisted crazily. At the first fork
a sign-post pointed one way to Tappenville and
another to Lower Millis, but said nothing of Miles.
But they took the right-hand road, after Sam had
pinned a note of direction to Steve on the post,
and went doggedly on, resisting the temptation to
leave the highway and try the short-cut across
country. The road seemed bent on travelling in
every direction save that in which they wanted to
go. There never was such a stupid, stubborn old
road as that! Murmurs of discontent began to
be heard. The fellows were thoroughly disappointed,
too, because all hope of winning the hike
was now idle. It was already after five o’clock
and doubtless by this time the “Reds” were comfortably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
encamped and waiting for supper. The
thought of that supper encouraged them to renewed
exertions.</p>

<p>It’s a long lane that has no turning, and at last
Sam, who had been watching anxiously for a good
half-hour for their destination, gave an exclamation
of relief. The winding road turned a sudden
corner, and there, straight ahead, loomed a white
triangle on which was lettered: “Railroad Crossing—Look
Out for the Engine.” With whoops
of joy the boys gained the track and set off northward,
fatigue and disappointment forgotten in the
prospect of reaching the end of the journey. Only
a hundred yards or so further on a wider road
than the one they had abandoned crossed the railway.
On one side, perhaps a half-mile away, lay
Indian Lake, glimpsed through a fringe of trees
that bordered a meadow. In that direction stood
a red-brown farm-house, and the sun, slipping for
an instant from the wrack of clouds above the
western horizon, flashed ruddily against the distant
windows. Turning their backs on the lake,
they followed the new road. A house came into
sight, a dog barked at them, somewhere a rooster
crowed, civilisation drew near. And then, without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
warning, the brief glimpse of sunlight faded
and the rain began once more. And at almost the
same moment a lane branched to the right ahead
of them and a sign nailed to a tree directed them
to “Centennial Park.”</p>

<p>With raincoats thrown hastily over their heads
to keep their blankets dry the boys broke into a
trot. The lane ascended a hill, a gleam of white
shone through the trees ahead, voices came to
them, and a moment later they were “out of the
woods” in more ways than one. The trees gave
place to open turf and they were on a hill, the lake
stretching below in the rain-blurred twilight. In
front was a roofed building, open on all sides.
To the left were some smaller structures; sheds,
booths, and so on, all tightly boarded up. Under
the big roof of the auditorium boys were lounging
or moving about, and as Sam’s squad crossed the
park a shout of greeting met them.</p>

<p>With rather less enthusiasm the newcomers
waved and answered. Tom Crossbush turned to
Sam. “They aren’t all there,” he said.</p>

<p>“Maybe, if Mr. Brown comes along soon, we’ll
beat them after all!”</p>

<p>“Why, no, they’re not all there by any means,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
answered Sam. “I see only about a dozen. Perhaps
the rest are around, though.”</p>

<p>“They’re all kids, too, sir!” said Joe Groom
excitedly. “They must be Mr. Gifford’s second
squad, sir!”</p>

<p>By this time they were close to the building and
some of the boys came out to meet them and Mr.
Haskins called from the shelter.</p>

<p>“That your first squad, Craig?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Yes. Is that yours?”</p>

<p>“No, second. Goodness knows where the rest
are. We’ve been here nearly an hour. Either
they took the wrong road or we did. We haven’t
seen them since about four o’clock!”</p>

<p>Sam smiled. “How many of you are there?”
he asked.</p>

<p>“Only eleven,” replied Mr. Haskins ruefully.
“You’ve got us beaten, I guess, unless the Chief
and Gifford show up soon. I suppose your second
squad will be right along?”</p>

<p>Sam shrugged. “I don’t believe so. As near
as I can figure it, we’ve done about nine miles, and
I guess the younger chaps will be pretty well
fagged. Queer how you got by your first squad,
though.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<p>“Mighty queer,” agreed the other. “There
was only one place——”</p>

<p>He stopped and gazed toward the entrance.
Sam’s eyes followed. Out from the grove moved a
group of boys. “There they are now,” said Sam.
“Only——”</p>

<p>But further speech was drowned by the shout
that went up from the assembled “Blues.” Over
the rail or down the steps they fled to meet the
arrivals, a small band of eight youths led by a
councillor who came across the turf with a
springy, unwearied step. Sam stared in surprise.
They weren’t “Reds” at all! They were——</p>

<p>“You win,” said Mr. Haskins, with a chuckle.</p>

<p>“Why, Sam, we took a chance,” Steve Brown was
explaining a few minutes later. “I got your message
all right, but that road didn’t look good to
me. So Chase shinned a tree on a hill and had a
look around and said he could see this building
plainly about two miles away. And we decided
that if we were to beat you fellows to it we’d
better cut across lots. So we did. Had a bit of
tough going for half a mile or so and then found
the lake and followed a sort of path that led along
the edge of it till we struck a good road down
there. Came through the village, made sure we
were headed right, and—here we are! How long
have you been here?”</p>

<p>“Not more than quarter of an hour,” said Sam.
“I wish I’d had the sense to think of that tree
business, Steve. I’ll bet you we’ve walked ten
miles this afternoon!”</p>

<p>Steve chuckled. “Don’t you care, Sam. We<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
beat the “Reds” to it. What sort of roads did
you find, Mr. Haskins?”</p>

<p>“Very good, most of the way. Pretty wet and
muddy in places, but not half bad. I can’t
imagine, though, what became of the others. We
lost sight of them about four o’clock, and——”</p>

<p>“You’ll soon know what happened,” interrupted
Sam, “for here they come now!”</p>

<p>It was a weary and footsore band that detached
itself from the gloom of the trees and approached
through the drizzling rain. Mr. Langham was
limping badly and many of the boys literally
dragged their feet. Mr. Gifford’s smile was a bit
grim as he waved a reply to the shout of welcome.</p>

<p>“Better late than never,” said Mr. Haskins.
“What happened, Gifford?”</p>

<p>“Lost our way somehow. Don’t ask us where
we’ve been. We don’t know. Of all beastly
country——!”</p>

<p>“It was quite all my fault,” interposed the
Chief. “It came to a question of two roads and
I picked out the wrong one. Well, here we are,
anyway, and I guess we’re not all dead yet. Sam,
as the defeated ones, we ought to do the toiling,
but you can see that our crowd is pretty badly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
tuckered out. Suppose you and Steve take some
of the chaps and see what can be done about getting
some fires lighted.” He glanced about the
building dubiously. “Not a very warm place for
the night, is it?” he continued. “Those boys
ought to get their feet dry, but I don’t just
see——”</p>

<p>“You leave it all to us, sir,” said Sam. “Better
sit down and get rested. Sorry you had such hard
luck.”</p>

<p>“Yes, it was tough on some of the youngsters.
This place seems dry, at least. Well——”</p>

<p>The Chief’s voice trailed into silence and, removing
the blanket from his shoulder, he made a
cushion of it and sat down with his back to the
railing. Then he smiled up at Sam and Steve
ruefully. “I’m just about all in,” he said. “I
don’t see how some of those boys stood it. By
Jove, I don’t!”</p>

<p>“Don’t worry about them, Chief,” said Mr.
Gifford. “They’ll be as fit as fiddles in the morning.
The question now is——”</p>

<p>“Fires and grub,” interrupted Steve cheerfully.</p>

<p>“You get your breath back, Andy. Sam and Mr.
Haskins and I will look after things. ‘Blues,’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
this way! Come on, fellows, we’re going to hunt
wood and build some fires. Scatter now! Bring
in all the dead branches you can find and anything
else that will burn. Never mind if it’s wet,
bring it along. But don’t do any damage to anything.
Remember you’re Scouts, fellows. Carry
the wood over there where you see those barrels
and boxes. Hustle now!”</p>

<p>Off they went with a will. Sam and Steve and
Mr. Haskins crossed to where, at some distance,
a litter of broken boxes and old barrels was
piled. Here, as they expected, they found a sandy
pit in which it was evidently the custom to burn
rubbish. “We can have a roaring old blaze here,”
said Steve. “Guess, though, we’d better have,
say, three small fires that we can get close up to.
Wish there was a shelter near, though. I suppose
this stuff is sopping wet.”</p>

<p>He pulled some of the underneath boxes out and
found that they were in places fairly dry, however,
and he and Sam proceeded to knock them to
pieces and store them in one of the barrels, which
they turned on its side. Mr. Haskins wandered
away toward a long open shed used for carriages.
A minute or two later the boys began to arrive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
with armfuls of branches, fragments of boxes and
such. It was all pretty wet, but, as Steve said,
once get your fire started and they’d burn finely
and all the hotter for being damp. Then Mr. Haskins
returned dragging a big piece of canvas, evidently
at one time either a portion of a tent or
a tarpaulin such as is used to cover loaded
wagons.</p>

<p>“I thought,” he explained, exhibiting his find
proudly, “that if we could manage to spread this
over our heads somehow——”</p>

<p>“Bully!” cried Steve. “We’ll fix it. Haskins,
you’re a wonder!” And the older councillor
smiled more proudly still.</p>

<p>And fix it they did, finally. One side of it was
laid on a row of the empty boxes and held in
place by stones. At the other corners they fixed
poles—or what answered for poles; one was a
long branch and the other an eight-foot board,—binding
the canvas to them with bits of string and
wire, and sinking the other ends in the gravel at
the edge of the pit. Fortunately, there was no
wind, or their improvised lean-to would soon have
toppled down. As it was it was by no means
large enough to shelter more than half their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
number, but it did make a fairly dry place in
which to serve supper.</p>

<p>Steve took Sam and they hurried off in search
of birch-trees. At first it seemed that birch was
the one variety of tree which did not grow in the
vicinity of Centennial Park, but at last, far down
near the railroad track, they descried a group
showing ghostlike in the fast-gathering twilight,
and it took them but a minute or so to circle the
trees with their knives and pull off strips of the
bark. When they turned back each had a good
armful. Then they set about starting the fires.
Steve whittled a pile of shavings from a piece of
fairly dry pine board under the shelter, tore some
of the birch-bark into small strips, and then laid
the fire on the gravel a few feet from the lean-to
and applied a match. The bark sizzled and curled
and flamed, the shavings caught, and Steve fed
the blaze with the driest of his wood. There was
a doubtful minute, but at last the fire took hold
with a roar, and the boys, who had begun to gather
about, sent up a cheer. Mr. Gifford and several
of the older youths appeared with cooking utensils
and food and took possession of the shelter. Two
more fires were started from the first, and soon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
what had appeared a half-hour before to be a
rather hopeless and depressing scene took on an
air of cheerfulness and comfort.</p>

<p>Kitty-Bett had provided plenty of cold meat,
bread and butter, and hard-boiled eggs. There
were doughnuts, too, dozens and dozens of them,
and those the boys devoured first, last, and all the
time. There was bacon ready for the frying, but
Mr. Gifford wisely decided not to attempt to cook
it under the circumstances. But three huge kettles
of tea were brewed, cans of condensed milk were
punctured, sugar and tin spoons were passed
around, and a deep and all-pervading silence held
for many minutes, a silence only accentuated by
infrequent remarks, short and crisp: “Sugar,
Billy!” “Pass this along, Tom.” “Meat,
please!”</p>

<p>When the first pangs of hunger had been
quieted, conversation began briskly. At least half
the boys narrated their personal adventures and
experiences, boasted of blistered heels and tired
muscles. Very kindly, the rain had decreased to
a fine drizzle that was scarcely more than a heavy
mist, and the twenty or so boys who were unable
to crowd under the tarpaulin ate in some comfort,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
curled up on the ground in their raincoats. From
time to time the fires were replenished, more
lazily as the warmth and food and the good hot
tea began to have effect. Kitty-Bett had provided
with a lavish hand. Had he not done so the
prospect of breakfast in the morning would have
looked dark, for there were never forty-three
healthier appetites gathered together than those
which the “Reds” and the “Blues” finally managed
to appease that evening!</p>

<p>At last, when no one could hold another crumb,
the fellows toppled against each other and the talk
grew fainter and fainter and ever more murmurous,
until, finally, a full-fledged snore broke forth,
and the sleepy youths roused themselves with a
laugh.</p>

<p>“McDowell’s suggestion is a good one,” said
Mr. Langham. “I vote we accept it, fellows.
Who’s for bed?”</p>

<p>Yawns of assent answered, and Ed Thursby,
rising unsteadily to his feet, collided with one of
the poles which held up the tarpaulin. Down
came the shelter with a swish of wet canvas, sparks
flew from the fires, and some twenty boys disappeared
from sight amidst shouts of laughter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
from those outside. Out they came, rolling or
crawling, and the party set off for bed.</p>

<p>Bare boards, even when softened by a raincoat
and a single thickness of blanket, do not make a
downy couch, but no complaints were heard. One
by one, with shoes for a pillow, the tired boys
dropped off to sleep. Over them blew the damp
night air, and from the roof and trees came the
steady patter of rain-drops. And from forty-three
motionless, blanket-wrapped forms came evidences
of healthy slumber.</p>

</div>


<p>Breakfast was over by half-past eight the next
morning, and the boys and councillors, fortified
by plenty of fried bacon, bread and butter, and
hot coffee—to say nothing of the remains of the
doughnut crop—were ready for the return trip.
Spirits were high, for sleep had rested and refreshed
them, and, to make life seem still better
worth living, the sun was out radiantly, the sky
was washed clean of clouds, and a crisp little
breeze blew from the distant lake.</p>

<p>It was decided that those wishing to make the
return journey on foot might do so, but that Mr.
Gifford should cross the lake by boat and return
with the launch and a sufficient number of the
camp row-boats to accommodate all who preferred
to go home that way. Fourteen fellows voted to
foot it back to camp by the northern route, and
Sam and Steve and Mr. Haskins decided to go
with them. So, as soon as breakfast was over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
they started off leisurely, while Mr. Gifford made
his way to the village to secure a boat to make the
trip across to The Wigwam. The fellows who
were to await his return waved good-bye to the
pedestrians and then set about amusing themselves.</p>

<p>That walk back was thoroughly enjoyable.
They had three hours and a half to do it in and
they could loiter as much as they pleased. The
roads were fast drying off under the influence
of sun and breeze and there was just enough zest
in the morning air to make exercise a pleasure.
Muscles soon forgot their stiffness, and by the
time the little party of seventeen had left the
railroad track and were on the dirt road everyone
was very merry. The woods along the way
were fragrant with the odour of moist earth and
fresh verdure, and every leaf looked crisp and
happy after the rain. Birds fluttered and darted,
chirped and sang, and when, presently, the party
paused at a tiny brook that crossed the road to
dip their tin cups in the sparkling water it seemed
that even the brook was trying its very best to
tell its joy.</p>

<p>There were many pauses and rests. As the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
sun grew warmer and the breeze lessened a comfortable
lassitude took the place of the first eagerness,
and the fellows were quite willing to stop
on any pretext. Often they had to wait for Mr.
Haskins, who, it appeared, was having a most
glorious time. He was forever darting off into
the woods to look at a tree he didn’t recognise, or
an oddly shaped fungus, or to examine some lichen
or moss. Invariably he returned with a trophy
to exhibit and expatiate on. His pockets were
quite filled long before they reached Indian Lake.
They didn’t enter the village, but passed it by
along the lake. There was a small amusement
park there; a boat-landing and some swings and a
merry-go-round and a few booths where one could
buy soda-water and pop-corn and candy and postcards;
and the party managed to spend a quarter
of an hour there most profitably for the vendors.
They tried the swings and drank soda and bought
candy and pop-corn. As few of the fellows had
any money with them Mr. Haskins became banker
and recorded the debts in the little memorandum
book he always carried. Then they went on again,
even more leisurely now by reason of the things
they had eaten and drank, and so, at a few minutes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
past noon, came in sight of The Wigwam and were
hailed by those who had returned by boat. Perhaps
the pedestrians swaggered a little as they
drew near. Why not? Had they not proved
their superiority to the faint-hearted ones who
had had to be carried home? Indeed, yes! And
so, gathering at the flag-pole, they raised their
voices in three lugubrious groans for “the Mollycoddles!”
And Mr. Haskins groaned as loudly
as any.</p>

<p>Two days later the tennis tournament started.
In order to swell the number of entries, Sam had
allowed Steve to persuade him to be his partner
in the doubles. Sam had never played tennis but
three or four times in his life, but Steve got him
out of bed at half-past five on two mornings and
tried to teach him the game. The attempt was not
greatly successful, however, and Steve and Sam,
giving fifteen, were speedily eliminated from the
contest. Even Steve’s excellent playing couldn’t
quite make up for Sam’s earnest but futile efforts.
The boys who watched the two councillors play
against George Porter and Ned Welch had difficulty
in keeping from laughing at Sam’s wild attempts
and awkward blunders. Finally, discovering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
that Sam, too, thought he was funny, they had
their laughs and Sam didn’t mind at all. Millson
Charrit, the Indians’ clever shortstop, captured
first place in the singles, and Porter and
Welch finally won the doubles championship,
but not until Joe Groom and Tom Crossbush,
giving half-fifteen, had run the last set to
8-all.</p>

<p>Then came the Annual Field Day, with nine
events, including a mile and seven-eighths cross-country
run. There was broad- and high-jumping,
pole-vaulting, sprinting, shot-putting, discus-throwing,
and low-hurdling. There were no remarkable
records established, although Gerald Jones did
better the camp record for the pole-vault. Perhaps
the surprise of the afternoon occurred when
Billy White, thirteen years old, romped in twenty
yards ahead of his nearest competitor in the cross-country
run. For that Billy got his name burned
on a nice clean pine panel and hung in the
“Trophy Room,” by which name a certain section
of wall in The Wigwam was known. To be
sure, Billy had not bettered the existing record,
but he had come within a few strides of equalling
it, and, in view of his age, his performance was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
considered worthy of perpetuation in the annals
of camp athletics.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Indians continued to pin defeats
on their baseball rivals, although their games with
the Mascots were never certain victories until the
last man was out. The Mascots gave Mr. Gifford’s
team several warm brushes, and occasionally
won a contest, but three times out of five
George Porter’s pitching decided the day. The
Brownies, ever hopeful, went down to defeat regularly
and cheerfully. That is not quite true,
though, for the Brownies did win two games that
summer, beating both the Mascots and the Indians.</p>

<p>It was shortly after the Field Day and well along
toward the last of August that Sam received, one
morning, a letter from Tom Pollock. Tom wrote
that he and Sid Morris were coming up to pay
a visit if Sam could find a place for them to sleep,
either at camp or nearby. In some perplexity
Sam consulted Mr. Langham.</p>

<p>“No trouble about it, Sam,” was the reply.
“We’ve got extra cots and plenty of room to set
them up. And there’s always something to eat.
We’re very glad to have visitors. Wish we had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
more of them. Tell your friends to come as guests
of The Wigwam for as long as they like to stay.”</p>

<p>Sam thanked the Chief gratefully and hurried
off to send a reply, and four days later Sam and
Steve walked over to Indian Lake and met the
visitors on the arrival of the eleven-twenty train,
which to-day rambled in at a quarter to twelve.
They came back in an ancient vehicle obtained from
the local livery stable, laughed and chattered all
the way, and descended in front of The Wigwam a
few minutes late for dinner. Each of the visitors
carried a suit-case and Sidney Morris also had
with him a large bundle wrapped in blue paper,
which, when Sam could no longer restrain his
curiosity, Sid informed him, contained two four-pound
boxes of mixed chocolates.</p>

<p>“For the crowd, you know,” explained Sid.
“Kids are usually crazy about candy. I remember
last summer at the lake I’d have given ten dollars
a pound for the stuff lots of times. You’d better
take charge of it, Sam, and ladle it out to them
after dinner.”</p>

<p>“We almost missed the train while he went
after that,” said Tom Pollock. “We had to run
all the way from Budlong’s to the station.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<p>“It was fine of you,” said Sam, “and the fellows
will be tickled to death.”</p>

<p>“<em>Sickened</em> to death, you mean,” chuckled Steve
Brown.</p>

<p>The new arrivals caused much interest in camp,
and after siesta—Tom and Sidney, being warned
of that period of enforced quiet, wandered off into
the woods—they were duly presented to most of
the older chaps. The candy was fairly distributed,
one big box going to The Wigwam and
one to The Tepee, and made a great hit. For the
next hour or two Sidney was easily the most popular
fellow in camp! The Brownies and Indians
held practice that afternoon—they were to meet
on the morrow—and Tom and Sidney volunteered
for service, Tom with the Indians and Sid with
Steve’s team. Tom’s fame as a pitcher soon got
about and some of the boys asked Sam if he
wouldn’t get Tom to pitch a little for them. So,
after practice was over, Sam donned a mask and
protector and Tom walked to the box.</p>

<p>“All right, fellows!” called Sam, after Tom
had slammed a dozen balls over in the warming-up
process. “Who wants to knock the first home
run?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<p>Rather sheepishly, Joe Groom picked out a bat
and stood up at the plate. Steve Brown smilingly
offered to umpire.</p>

<p>“Don’t knock him out of the box, Joe,” counselled
someone. “I want a hit myself.”</p>

<p>“That’s right, Joe. Be easy with him. A
three-bagger will do!”</p>

<p>Sam stooped and held three fingers against his
mitt, Tom wound up, stepped forward easily, and
the ball travelled to the plate. Joe, frowning intently,
swung. The ball thumped into Sam’s mitt.</p>

<p>“Strike!” droned Steve, and the audience
chuckled. Joe grinned and tapped his bat on the
plate.</p>

<p>“A peach of a drop,” muttered George Porter
admiringly.</p>

<p>“All right, Tom!” called Sam, thoroughly enjoying
himself. “One more, now, just like it!”
But only two fingers lay against the mitt this
time and when the ball broke it curved cannily to
the left, and Joe, backing away from it, heard
again Mr. Brown’s fateful, “Strike—two!” A
howl went up from the watchers, who now began
to cluster behind Mr. Brown in their desire to
watch the breaks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<p>“Right over now, Tom!” Sam held his hands
wide and Tom nodded, wiped one palm on his
trousers, poised the ball and shot it forward. Joe
declared that he never saw it from the time it left
the pitcher’s hand until he looked around and saw
it in Sam’s mitten. “Talk about your fast ones!”
he marvelled. “Say, honest, fellows, that ball
<em>travelled</em>!”</p>

<p>“He’s out!” called Steve, and there was a rush
to take his place. George Meldrum secured it, and
after him Tom Crossbush, and then a dozen others
tried their fortunes. But not a hit resulted. In-shoot
and out, slow ball and fast, drop and floater,
high ball and low, succeeded each other, Sam
changing the pace in a thoroughly bewildering
manner and Tom answering every signal. Finally
Steve Brown tried his luck and, after slamming
ineffectually twice, managed to roll the ball a
dozen yards toward third base. Then Mr. Gifford,
egged on by the boys, had his inning and, when
Tom had fooled him on two low ones at which he
made no offer, caught a fast one and sent it arching
into right field, so winning much applause.</p>

<p>“Foul!” declared Steve Brown.</p>

<p>“<em>What!</em>” demanded Mr. Gifford.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p>“Foul!”</p>

<p>“Robber!” shrieked the batter, imitating an
infuriated player and brandishing his bat over
Steve’s head. “You’re a bum umpire!”</p>

<p>“The bench for youse,” growled Steve. “Off
the field!”</p>

<p>“How much are they payin’ yer?”</p>

<p>“That’ll be about all,” returned Steve, with
much dignity. “You’re fined ten dollars.”</p>

<p>Mr. Gifford, disgustedly hurling his bat to the
ground and then kicking it out of the way, stalked
off, muttering, to the delight of the fellows. On
the way back to the camp Tom was surrounded by
a guard of admiring youths who begged him to
show them how to pitch that drop or that floater.
Sidney was no longer the hero.</p>

<p>The visitors had a good time every minute.
They joined the boys in the water at “plunge,”
ate ravenously of everything set before them at
supper, declaring themselves “strong for those
doughnuts,” and entered into everything that
came along with genuine enthusiasm. Tom conducted
a class in pitching after supper until it was
too dark to see the ball. Later, at camp-fire, Mr.
Langham called on the guests for entertainment.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
Tom begged off, but Sidney, who appeared to be
in the most boisterous spirits, declared that if
someone had a concertina he would chant them
a ditty. He finally compromised on a banjo, however,
and when he had picked at it a moment,
broke out into a monotonous tune to which he
supplied words as follows:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“O—oh, we came here on the train to-day, it was a dandy ride.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Tom sat upon the cowcatcher, but I sat down inside.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The train it was an hour late and we were late as well;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The reason why the train was late the conductor wouldn’t tell.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Sam Craig he met us at the place where we alighted down;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">He had a smile upon his face, and so had Mr. Brown!<br /></span>
<span class="i1">They put us in an ancient thing, I guess it was a hack;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And I think I’d rather walk than ride whenever I go back!<br /></span>
<span class="i1">We met a royal welcome here and many things to eat,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Roast beef and apple pie and such until we couldn’t speak.<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
<span class="i1">The fellows are a dandy lot, the councillors the same,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The Chief likewise, and here’s to him; Mr. Langham is his name.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">We played baseball and swam and dived, and then we ate some more,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And when you mention doughnuts I would like to cry ‘encore!’<br /></span>
<span class="i1">We like the way you’ve treated us, you’re all in our good books,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">But oh, the one we like the best he is the man who cooks!”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Sidney ended with a final strum of the banjo
and the audience set up a wild howl of laughter
and applause and loudly demanded more. But Sid
declared that that was the only song he knew.
“Besides,” he said, stretching out and pillowing
his head on Tom’s knees, “I’m too full of doughnuts
to sing. Somebody else try it.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think any of us could improvise as well
as that,” replied the Chief, with a laugh. “I call
that pretty clever, fellows.”</p>

<p>“Not bad,” said Tom judicially, “but he got the
last line wrong, Mr. Langham. That wasn’t the
way I taught it to him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>

<p>“You!” grunted Sidney scathingly, “you
couldn’t find a rhyme for ‘lemon’!”</p>

<p>“There isn’t any,” piped up young Chase.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, there is,” said Tom.</p>

<p>“What?” Sidney demanded.</p>

<p>“The rhyme for ‘lemon’ is ‘Sidney,’” was the
sweet response. After they got through chuckling
at that bit of wit they sang songs until it was time
for prayer.</p>

<p>It wasn’t until the boys had retired to the dormitories
that Sam had an opportunity to hear the
home news from Tom and Sidney. The three sat
on the porch of The Tepee and talked until it was
nearly time for “lights” and Sam heard all the
gossip of Amesville. It wouldn’t greatly interest,
us, but Sam found it most absorbing and asked
many questions and began to feel a little bit homesick
withal. At ten they went to bed, Sidney and
Tom being accommodated with cots sandwiched
in between Sam’s and Harry Codman’s, an arrangement
that allowed them to lie very close together
and whisper cautiously long after they
should have been silent.</p>

<p>Tom and Sidney remained until the second day
and then, cheered to the echo by the campers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
climbed into that same “ancient thing” that Sid
had so eloquently sung of and, accompanied by
Sam, drove back to the station. Sam felt a bit
forlorn after the train had whisked them away
and he walked back to camp rather wishing that
he too was on his way to Amesville. But that
feeling didn’t last long, not long enough, in fact,
to prevent him from eating a very hearty dinner!</p>

<p>The day following Mr. Langham made a trip
to Columbus. He was away only one night, returning
the next afternoon with many packages,
most of which represented commissions from the
boys. He also brought back a piece of news which
he divulged that evening at camp-fire. The nights
were getting rather cool now and sweaters and
blankets were appreciated, and the fire was bigger
and hotter.</p>

<p>“Fellows,” announced Mr. Langham, “coming
up in the train this morning I ran into a man I
used to know at college, a chap named Scovill.
We got to talking about things, old times and old
acquaintances, you know, just as you fellows do,
I dare say——”</p>

<p>Chuckles from the circle.</p>

<p>“—and it turned out that Mr. Scovill has a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
boys’ camp, much like this, I suppose, though a
bit older and larger, at a place called Mount
Placid, just across the line in the next state.
Seems they play baseball at his camp—Camp
Placid, he calls it—and he thinks he’s got the best
summer-camp ball team around this part of the
world. I told him”—Mr. Langham laughed softly—“I
told him he might have a pretty fair team,
but I knew of a better one. He asked where it
was and what it was called, and I said it was located
at Indian Lake and was called The Wigwam
Baseball Team.”</p>

<p>Fervid applause from his hearers.</p>

<p>“Well, to make a long story short, fellows, he
issued a challenge to us. ‘You bring your team
up to Placid,’ he said, ‘and play us. We’ve got
plenty of room and can look after you overnight
and give you some real food.’ I thanked him and
told him I’d talk it over when I got back and let
him know. We looked up trains and found that
we could leave here early in the morning, on that
seven-forty-five express, and get to Mount Placid
at about eleven. We’d have to stay over there
until the next forenoon at about ten-thirty. The
one objection is just this. If we are to try conclusions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
with those folks we’ve got to make up a
team of our best players, councillors included—the
Placid team has four councillors on it, he tells
me—and then get in a week or so of practice. If
we do that it’s going to interfere badly with our
‘long hike,’ which is set for September fourth.
If we postpone the hike we interfere with Visitors’
Day, the ninth. And we don’t want to do
that, because that date is set down in the camp-booklet
and parents and friends are doubtless arranging
to come then, and if we change the date
there’ll be a lot of confusion. Now, I’ve been
wondering how it would do if we all went to
Mount Placid, the whole kit and kaboodle of
us——”</p>

<p>Interruption of enthusiastic cheering.</p>

<p>“—saw the game and then hiked back from
there. We’d have seventy-odd miles to do and
could take four days to do it in if necessary. It
wouldn’t be any trick to ship our things to Mount
Placid by express a day or two ahead. There’d
be the matter of railway fares, of course, and perhaps
some of you wouldn’t feel like paying out
so much money.” Mr. Langham paused questioningly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<p>“Nobody’d mind, sir,” someone shouted.
“We’ll all go, Chief!”</p>

<p>“Well, that would be the only drawback, I
guess. We’ll think it over and talk about it again
to-morrow night.”</p>

<p>“Beg pardon, sir,” said Steve Brown, “but
wouldn’t it be better to settle it now? If we’re
going to play those fellows we’ll need a lot of
practice. We ought to make up our team to-morrow
and get busy. Every day would count,
I guess.”</p>

<p>“That’s right, Chief,” confirmed Mr. Gifford.
“Why not find out now whether they are any of
the fellows who would rather not go to the expense
of the trip?”</p>

<p>“Then you like the idea, fellows?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir!” “You bet we do!” “We’ll trim
those chaps, sir!”</p>

<p>“All right, then. Now, are there any of you
who can’t afford the trip, or who don’t want to
spend that much money? One way and another,
it will probably cost each of you nearly four
dollars.”</p>

<p>Silence prevailed. There were whispers finally,
but no dissenting voice until Gerald Jones piped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
up with: “I haven’t got that much, sir, and my
folks are away from home and I don’t know where
to get at them, sir, but if you’d lend me about two
dollars, sir——”</p>

<p>Amidst laughter Mr. Langham agreed to supply
the deficiency for Jones and for any other boy
whose funds were unequal to the demand, and enthusiasm
reigned. Out of the babel that ensued
Mr. Haskins was heard to inquire mildly when it
was planned to make the trip. The Chief considered.</p>

<p>“This is Thursday,” he said finally. “If we
say a week from to-day for the game we will have
five days for practice. Would that be sufficient,
Andy?”</p>

<p>Mr. Gifford thought it would.</p>

<p>“Very well, then. I’ll write Scovill to-morrow
that we’ll be with him next Thursday loaded for
bear. We’ll stay at his camp Thursday night and
start the hike the next day. To-morrow we’ll get
the map and work it out. I’ll leave the matter of
forming the team to you, Andy. But you and
Steve and Sam had better count on playing, I
think. I dare say they’ve got a pretty good team
up there and we don’t want them to beat us too
badly.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>

<p>“With five afternoons of practice,” replied Mr.
Gifford confidently, “we can turn out a nine that
will put the ‘acid’ in ‘Placid’!”</p>

<p>And above the laughter Mr. Haskins was heard
soberly and earnestly agreeing.</p>

<small>MAKING THE NINE</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Busy days followed. The Wigwam fixed its mind
on the following Thursday and laboured enthusiastically.
On the morning after Mr. Langham’s
announcement Mr. Gifford, Sam, and Steve
walked up the slope to what was known as the
Pulpit Tree, a big beech, under whose far-spreading
branches divine service was held on Sundays
when the weather permitted. There, sitting
cross-legged on the ground, they held council over
the making of the baseball team that was to represent
the camp.</p>

<p>“Let’s start with the battery,” said Mr. Gifford.
“Of course George Porter will pitch.”</p>

<p>“He may not last the game, though,” said
Sam. “The question is who shall we put in after
him?”</p>

<p>“One of us, I guess. Can you twirl?”</p>

<p>Sam shook his head. “Neither can I,” said
Steve. “How about you, Andy?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<p>“A little; at least, I’ve done some of it. But
I haven’t anything much on the ball. I used to
be able to pitch an out-shoot that sometimes got
over, and that’s about all, except a fairly fast
ball.”</p>

<p>“My idea, then,” said Sam, “would be for you
to start the game and hold them as long as you
can. Then we’ll put in Porter.”</p>

<p>“Maybe they won’t tumble to you for three or
four innings,” said Steve encouragingly. “I dare
say Porter will be able to go six. You’ll catch,
Sam?”</p>

<p>“Why, yes, I suppose so. Or if you think we’d
better give the fellows all the show we can, Benson
could start.”</p>

<p>“We need a steady catcher, Sam. Of course,
we want to let the fellows get all the fun they
can out of it, but there’s no use throwing the
game away on that account. Battery, then, to
start, Gifford and Craig.” He set it down
on the pad he held. “Now then, who for
first?”</p>

<p>“Wait a minute,” said Sam. “Where’s Steve
going to play?”</p>

<p>“Put me in the outfield,” said Steve. “I can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
catch a fly fairly well, but that’s about the limit of
my abilities.”</p>

<p>“I’ve seen you run bases quite a bit,” said Mr.
Gifford drily.</p>

<p>“You wouldn’t want to play second?” asked
Sam.</p>

<p>Steve looked alarmed. “Great Scott, no!”</p>

<p>“All right. Only I’d like mighty well to have
a chap on second who could handle throws from
the plate. Ed Thursby’s a good fielder, but he’s
weak at covering the bag on a steal.”</p>

<p>“Why don’t you try it, Steve?” asked Mr. Gifford.
“We’ve got a dozen fellows who can play in
the outfield.”</p>

<p>“Well, if you like,” replied the other doubtfully.
“Maybe I can get the hang of it after a
few days.”</p>

<p>“Good. Now, first baseman: Sawyer?”</p>

<p>“I suppose so,” agreed Sam.</p>

<p>“Rot!” said Steve. “Murdock can play all
around Sawyer.”</p>

<p>It was Mr. Gifford’s turn to look doubtful.
“He’s pretty good, but it seems to me Sawyer is
steadier.”</p>

<p>“Look here,” said Sam. “Seems to me we’re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
going at this thing all wrong. What we ought to
do is to pick out three or four fellows for each
position and give them all a fair try. There’s no
need of selecting the final team until, say, next
Tuesday. By that time the fellows will have
shown what they can do.”</p>

<p>“That’s so,” agreed Steve. “Why not make
up two teams, Andy? A First and a Second, you
know. Pick out those we think are the best for
the First, and then if any of the Second team
fellows show up better we can swap them
over.”</p>

<p>“That sounds reasonable. Come on, then.
First Team: Porter, pitcher; Craig, catcher; Murdock,
first baseman. Second Team: Gifford,
pitcher; Benson, catcher; Sawyer, first baseman.
How’s that?”</p>

<p>“All right. Now let’s go on with the First.
Steve will play second. For shortstop there’s
either Fairchild or Charrit. I guess Charrit has
the call. That puts Fairchild on the Second. For
third?”</p>

<p>“Your man is better than mine there,” said
Mr. Gifford. “Don’t you say so, Steve?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Jones ought to have it, unless you put<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
Crossbush there. He plays pretty well at first
and might do better at third.”</p>

<p>“We’ll put him down for the Second,” said Mr.
Gifford. “For that matter, fellows, there’s
Thursby. He’s going to get left out of the game
unless we put him in the outfield. We’ve got to
consider batting ability as well as fielding, haven’t
we?”</p>

<p>“That’s so,” Steve agreed. “Better put
Thursby down on the Second and let Crossbush
substitute. We’ve got to fix it so we can give
them all a fair trial. It’s not going to be so
easy.”</p>

<p>“First Team outfield, now. Peterson? Meldrum?
And how about Codman? He’s a bit
young.”</p>

<p>“We ought to get hitters in the outfield,” suggested
Sam. “Codman isn’t much of a batter, is
he, Andy?”</p>

<p>“No, he isn’t. How about that centre fielder
of yours, Steve? Wonson, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Jack Wonson, yes. He’s only fair, though.
Joe Groom is a good hand with the stick. Why
not put him in the outfield?”</p>

<p>“Might try him. That makes it Peterson, Meldrum,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
and Groom for the First. For the Second——”</p>

<p>“Codman,” suggested Sam, “and Simpson.”</p>

<p>“And Wonson?” asked Mr. Gifford.</p>

<p>“Give him a try,” agreed Steve.</p>

<p>“That fixes it, then. Better have a substitute
infielder, though, for the First.”</p>

<p>“Temple,” said Sam.</p>

<p>“Right-o. Anything else?”</p>

<p>“Don’t think so.” Steve took the list and
looked it over. “That looks all right to me.
Suppose Sam captains the First and you the
Second, Andy.”</p>

<p>“All right. I suppose some of the fellows are
going to be disappointed.”</p>

<p>“Bound to be some,” agreed Steve. “Can’t be
avoided, though. We can take a good big string
of substitutes, I suppose, and that will help some.”</p>

<p>“If the game happened to go our way we might
use a lot of subs,” Sam said. “Anyway, we could
take them along on the chance.”</p>

<p>“You and Andy work up your batting orders,”
said Steve. “Put me about second on the list,
Sam. If I can get my base one way or another I
dare say I can worry that Placid pitcher.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>

<p>“He will be mighty placid if you don’t,”
chuckled Mr. Gifford.</p>

<p>“I’ll copy your list off for you, Sam.”</p>

<p>“I wonder who they’ll have to umpire,” said
Steve while Mr. Gifford was busy writing.
“Sometimes a good deal depends on that.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I guess they’ll find a chap who’ll be fair
to both sides,” replied Sam.</p>

<p>“I don’t doubt that. Only thing is, will he
know how? I’d rather play with an umpire who
knew how to ump and who was ag’in’ me than with
one who didn’t know and was as fair as all-get-out.
It’s the blundering sort who raise the dickens with
a game sometimes.”</p>

<p>“There you are,” said Mr. Gifford. “And
let’s start things up as soon after two as possible.
We’ve got good material in camp, fellows, and we
ought to be able to turn out a corking team. If we
had two weeks instead of one we’d do it, too.”</p>

<p>“Well, we’ve been playing steadily all summer,”
said Steve, “and it won’t be for lack of
practice if we get licked.”</p>

<p>“Let’s not get licked,” said Sam quietly.</p>

<p>“Hm,” said Steve, and, “Oh, all right,” Mr.
Gifford laughed. “Just as you say, Sam!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<p>Five days of hard work, then, for all hands.
But enthusiasm was rampant and no one lagged.
The journey to Mount Placid, the game, and the
hike back had caught the fellows’ fancy, and nothing
much else was talked about. As Mr. Gifford
had predicted, there were some boys who felt keen
disappointment at being left off the teams, but they
all tried their best not to show it. “Every fellow
for the Camp!” was the slogan. On Monday the
First and Second played a full nine-inning game
and played it for all they were worth. It was
understood that the first selections for the two
teams were only tentative and that a player had
only to show his right to a position on the First
Team to get it. And with this in mind every fellow
worked his hardest, either to stay where he
was on the First or to secure promotion from the
Second. There were a few changes, but not as
many as might have been looked for. On the
whole, the councillors’ selections for the First
Team proved wise ones.</p>

<p>That Monday game was ultimately won by
Sam’s team, 13 to 10, and was featured by a lot
of hard hitting by both sides and some really fast
fielding. Mr. Gifford, in the points for the Second,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
pitched a fair game and Benson caught him handsomely.
But George Porter was on his mettle,
too, and had the better of the battle. Sam
doubted the wisdom of allowing Porter to pitch
the whole of nine innings, but the desire to win
that game got the better of his discretion, and,
besides, there was no one to take Porter’s place.</p>

<p>On Tuesday there was no real game, but there
was a full two hours of the most strenuous batting
and fielding and base-running, with every
candidate getting a chance. And then, on Tuesday
evening, the three councillors got together
and picked the team that was to battle for the
honour of The Wigwam on Thursday. It was no
light task, that, as Mr. Gifford explained later
at camp-fire.</p>

<p>“We all wished,” he announced to the attentive
audience, “that a baseball team comprised eighteen
men instead of nine, because there are at
least eighteen of you who deserve places. It’s
been hard work making a choice in lots of cases,
and we may have made mistakes. But we’ve done
our honest best, fellows, and we’ve judged you
only on performance. Some of you are going to
be disappointed. That’s unavoidable. To those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
who have striven and failed the camp owes its
thanks. One thing I am quite sure of, however,
and that is that those of you who aren’t chosen
will hold no resentment, but will ‘pull’ just as
hard. Well, here’s the list, fellows.”</p>

<p>Mr. Gifford leaned forward so that the firelight
fell on the sheet of paper he held.</p>

<p>“Porter and Gifford, pitchers; Craig and Benson,
catchers; Murdock, first base; Brown, second;
Crossbush, third; Thursby, shortstop; Meldrum,
right field; Groom, centre field; Peterson, left
field; substitutes, Charrit, Temple, Sawyer,
Simpson, and Wonson.”</p>

<p>A hearty cheer arose as Mr. Gifford finished.
Disappointed ones grinned hard and shouted loudest.
Successful candidates were pummelled and
thumped and there was a great to-do until Mr.
Langham arose.</p>

<p>“I don’t know much about it, fellows,” he said,
“but I guess we can trust Mr. Gifford and Mr.
Brown and Mr. Craig. I feel certain that they
have chosen fairly and well. A good many of you
had to be left out. They left me out, too. And
Mr. Haskins. But he and I, and all the rest of
us who haven’t been selected, are going to cheer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
just as hard. I hope we shall win that game, fellows,
but if we don’t, let’s show those Mount
Placid chaps that we are bully good losers. In
any case, we’re going to have a good time. We’re
going to stand together and pull together for a
victory, and if we don’t get it we’re going to keep
on smiling. That’s all, I guess, except that I
think we ought to give a good big cheer for the
team!”</p>

<p>It was given with a will, not once but twice, and
there were cries of “Speech! Speech!” And that
reminded someone that they hadn’t been told who
was to captain the team and the question was
propounded. It was decided that the team members
should vote for captain and instantly the
names of the three councillors were proposed.
But Mr. Gifford replied that he believed the
honour should go to one of the boys and in the
end the choice fell on Ed Thursby. They cheered
Ed then and again demanded a speech, but the
newly elected captain firmly refused to oblige. It
was Mr. Gifford who finally came to his assistance.</p>

<p>“Since,” he said, “Thursby is overcome with
the honour you have done him and is blushing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
over there so that for a moment I mistook him
for the fire, I take it on myself to reply for him.
Here’s what Ed would say if he made that speech:
‘Fellows, I appreciate what you’ve done and I
thank you for it. Let’s all do our best from now
on. For my part, fellows, I don’t see why we
shouldn’t everlastingly whale the daylights out
of those chaps up there. Anyhow, let’s try to! I
thank you one and all!’”</p>

<p>When the laughter subsided Mr. Gifford added:
“To-morrow, fellows, there’ll be only a very short
practice, for there’s going to be a lot to do in
the way of packing and getting ready. Right after
siesta every fellow must get his bag ready. Don’t
put in more than you’ll need. Remember that
when we start the hike we’ve got to get down to
essentials. Those of you who were here last year
will know what to take. For the benefit of those
who were not I’ll just say that the nearer you can
come to limiting your pack to a toothbrush and a
cake of soap the better off you’ll be! Now then,
let’s have a song or two to end up with. What’ll
it be, fellows?”</p>

<small>ON CONQUEST BENT</small></h2>
</div>


<p>At a few minutes before seven on Thursday morning
the last coach rolled away from The Wigwam.
Everyone was in fine spirits. The morning was
mild and still, and the sun, low above the eastern
hills, was burning off the last pearl-grey wraiths
of curling mist from the surface of the lake,
promising a fine day for the journey and the
game to follow. Only Kitty-Bett and Jerry remained
behind to keep camp. Up the long hill
road went the coaches, swaying and creaking,
while, inside and out, filled with the excitement of
the adventure, the boys laughed and shouted merrily.
At the last, since there had been a delay
in starting due to Ned Welch’s inability to remember
where he had placed his suit-case, there
was a wild gallop into the town, the crazy stages
rolling like ships at sea, and an excited scrambling
at the station where the through express puffed
and hissed impatiently. Then they were off, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
the rumble and click of flying wheels in their ears
and the green morning world speeding past them
on each side.</p>

<p>They had one day-coach almost to themselves,
and what few other passengers were there were
good-natured and sympathetic. Had they not been
they might have resented the noise and the pranks
that ensued. After awhile, though, the boys
quieted down. Most of them had been awake since
dawn and by the middle of the forenoon many had
laid their heads back and were frankly sleeping.
Later they changed to a branch road. The new
train, consisting of two coaches and a combination
baggage and smoker, was already fairly well-filled
when they descended on it, and so for the
rest of the way many of them had to stand in the
aisles or perch themselves on uptilted suit-cases.
Fortunately, this phase of the journey was soon
over and they were piling out on the platform of
a small station where carriages and wagons
awaited them and where three men in camp costume
of grey shirts and khaki trousers smilingly
welcomed them. One of the men was Mr. Scovill,
and the other two were introduced as Mr. Phillips
and Mr. Neetal. Mr. Scovill was a very tall man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
with a thin face, sunburned, bearded, and kindly.
The two councillors were young college men, one
stout and jovial and the other slight and shy-looking.
After introductions were over and baggage
had been rounded up the party poured into
the carriages and were whisked away over a
pleasant sunlit road that ascended steeply, past
pastures and knolls and across a rattling bridge
that spanned a stream, toward where a rounded
and wooded hill rose against the summer sky.</p>

<p>Mount Placid Camp was not greatly different
from The Wigwam. The buildings, five in number,
were spread along a narrow plateau at the
base of the mountain from where one overlooked
the valley below and had an uninterrupted view
of many miles of interesting country beyond. The
buildings were older than those at The Wigwam,
and were weathered to pleasing tones of grey and
brown. Some eighty grey-shirted youths had
gathered in front of the mess-hall, the central
building at the camp, and cheered lustily as the
visitors rolled up. The Mount Placid boys averaged
perhaps a year older than The Wigwam fellows,
and they impressed Sam, for one, as being
a particularly fine and healthy-looking lot. Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
Scovill, for the occasion, had cleared an entire
dormitory, and to this the visitors were conducted.
Three rows of cots left the long hall rather
crowded, but nobody minded and there was a wild
rush to claim beds. Dinner was served to the
visitors at twelve o’clock, after which the resident
fellows had theirs. The Chiefs and councillors of
both camps ate together and quite filled one of
the long tables. Mr. Scovill and his assistants,
seven in all, were hospitable to a degree, and the
food was excellent. It was quite a merry party,
and before they left the table it had been decided
that next year the Mount Placid Nine should journey
to The Wigwam and play a return game.</p>

<p>“We may not be able to treat you as well as
you’re treating us, Scovill,” said Mr. Langham,
“but we’ll do our best.”</p>

<p>After the second table had been fed the fellows
made friends quickly and, in groups of from two
or three to a dozen, went over the camp and explored
the trails that wound up the mountain.
Shortly after dinner a powerful roadster automobile
shot into sight up the road with a hoarse
shriek of its horn and came to a stop in front of
the camp. Mr. Scovill, excusing himself, walked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
across and shook hands with the man who had
leaped nimbly out and brought him over to the
group of councillors.</p>

<p>He was a solidly built, broad-shouldered, and
deep-chested man of about thirty-three or four,
with a sunburned face, a boyish eagerness of
manner, and a jovial laugh. There was something
very winning in that laugh.</p>

<p>“Langham,” said Mr. Scovill, “I want you to
know Mr. York. Mr. York is a neighbour of mine
and has a small place of a few thousand acres
just below here. He has very kindly consented
to umpire for us if that is agreeable to you. Mr.
York, Langham is Director of The Wigwam Camp,
at Indian Lake.”</p>

<p>“Temporarily removed to Mount Placid,”
laughed Mr. Langham as he shook hands. “We’ll
be pleased to have Mr. York officiate this afternoon.
Very kind of him, I’m sure, to accept such
a thankless task.”</p>

<p>“Not at all. I’m going to enjoy it,” responded
Mr. York, shaking hands with the visiting councillors.
“I used to play a bit myself. You have
a fine day for your visit, Mr. Langham.”</p>

<p>The group seated themselves on the steps and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
Mr. York, observing Sam closely, said: “I’ve seen
you somewhere before, haven’t I, Mr. Gray?”</p>

<p>“Craig is the name,” corrected Mr. Scovill.
Sam, surprised, shook his head doubtfully.</p>

<p>“I don’t think so,” he replied. “I live in Amesville,
Ohio.”</p>

<p>“Amesville! Of course! Thought I wasn’t mistaken.”
Mr. York smiled in satisfaction. “I’ll
tell you where I saw you, Mr. Craig, and how. It
was about three months ago. I stopped off at
Amesville to see a friend of mine, John Holden.
Perhaps you know him?”</p>

<p>Sam shook his head.</p>

<p>“Well, he’s a newcomer in Amesville; practising
law; a nice chap. You ought to meet him.
When you go home drop into his office some day
and tell him John York said you were to be
friends. You’ll like him and he will like you.”</p>

<p>Sam murmured rather embarrassed thanks.</p>

<p>“It happened to be a Saturday and Johnny and
I, having nothing better to do, jumped on a car
and went out to see the high school team play
ball with some visiting nine; forget who the other
chaps were. Johnny used to play shortstop when
I was catching for Warner College, and we’re both<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
fans. So we went out and saw that game. It
was a good one, too. You were catching for the
Amesville team, Craig.” Mr. York paused for
corroboration and Sam nodded.</p>

<p>“You fellows won. You had a pitcher who had
grey matter under his cap. Had a lot on the ball,
too. What was his name?”</p>

<p>“Pollock, sir.”</p>

<p>“That’s it! I remember it was some sort of a
fish. Well”—Mr. York turned to the others enthusiastically—“that
chap Pollock turned the
trick in the last inning as neatly as you please.
As I recall it the score stood something like three
to one in favour of Amesville. That right,
Craig?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“The visitors were at bat and there were two
out and the bases were filled. Mind you, the visitors
only needed two to tie, and, with two gone,
they were desperate. This chap Pollock had
pitched a fine, heady game, and he went after the
next batter as cool as a cucumber. Had two
strikes on him, I think, when the man on third
lit out for the plate on the wind-up. I suppose
when Pollock got himself together that runner<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
was halfway to the plate. Now”—Mr. York put
the question to one of the Mount Placid councillors—“what
would you have done, Williams, if you’d
been in Pollock’s place?”</p>

<p>Mr. Williams hesitated. “Only one thing to
have done,” he said finally. “Plug to the catcher
as fast as I knew how!”</p>

<p>Mr. York chuckled. “That’s what I’d have
done. I guess that’s what Craig here expected.
But this Pollock chap had a head on his shoulders.
When the man on third dug for the plate the
other runners set out after him, of course. Well,
Pollock realised that if he threw to the catcher the
ball might go wide or the catcher might—begging
Mr. Craig’s pardon—might drop it or it might be
too late in any event to make the out. So what
does he do but whirl around and slam the ball over
to third baseman, who was running back to
cover the bag. Third baseman makes a nice catch,
blocks off the runner from second and—there
you are! Three out and the score three to
two!”</p>

<p>“Clever work!” said Mr. Williams. “You’re
right, Mr. York; that fellow had brains.”</p>

<p>“You bet he had! Where is he now, Craig?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>

<p>“Amesville, sir. He has two more years in
High School.”</p>

<p>“Isn’t that the same chap who visited camp a
week or so ago?” asked Mr. Gifford.</p>

<p>“Yes, that was Tom,” replied Sam. “He’s a
nice fellow and we think he’s a pretty fine
pitcher.”</p>

<p>“Looked so to me,” agreed Mr. York. “And
I want to say, too, that you caught as pretty a
game as I want to see, Craig. As I used to wear
a mask myself I always watch the catcher’s work,
and you certainly played a nice game. Are you
catching to-day?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. At least, I’m going to start the
game.”</p>

<p>“How’s your pitcher?”</p>

<p>“Fairly good for a youngster,” said Mr. Gifford.
“Porter’s only fifteen, I believe.”</p>

<p>“You don’t say?” The speaker turned, with
a laugh, to Mr. Williams. “You’ll have to watch
out, Williams, and not let the kid outpitch
you.”</p>

<p>The councillor looked a bit dismayed. “Perhaps
we ought to let one of the boys pitch,” he
said doubtfully. “It doesn’t seem quite a fair<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
thing. We thought, Mr. Langham, that probably
one of your councillors would pitch for you.”</p>

<p>“Don’t let that worry you,” replied the Chief.
“We have Mr. Gifford here to step into the breach
if he’s needed. Porter’s a pretty clever pitcher
if he <em>is</em> young. By the way, what time do we
start, Scovill?”</p>

<p>“Three o’clock. It will be a little cooler by
then. Besides, it gives a chance for the Greenwood
boys to get over here. There’s another camp
on the other side of the mountain, Langham.
We had a sort of a date to play with them to-day,
but they were quite satisfied to postpone it.”</p>

<p>“Why, I’m sorry! I didn’t know we were interfering
with——”</p>

<p>“Not a bit! Not a bit! Greenwood’s just as
well pleased to come over and look on to-day. It
takes them nearly an hour to hike around here,
and that’s one reason I thought we’d wait until
three.” He looked at his watch. “They ought
to be showing up pretty soon now. I suppose your
boys will want to do a little practising before the
game. Any time they’d like to go down to the
field I’ll send someone along to show them the
way.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Gifford consulted his watch in turn. “It’s
twenty past two,” he said. “Perhaps we’d better
go now, Mr. Scovill. I’d like them to put in about
twenty minutes or so to limber up.”</p>

<p>“Certainly. Joe, you show Mr. Gifford the
way, will you?”</p>

<p>Mr. Phillips assented with alacrity and Mr. Gifford,
Sam, and Steve went off to get into their
togs and gather the players together. When they
had left, Mr. York said: “A born ball-player, that
young Craig. I’ll be glad to see him in action
again. It’s funny about catchers. Their job is
the pivotal one on the team and yet they don’t
get half the credit they deserve. I suppose the
average fan will tell you what every man on the
team did in a game before he will mention the
catcher’s work at all. There’s not very much
chance for spectacular stunts behind the plate, and
I guess that’s why the catcher doesn’t get in the
spotlight more. Just the same, if I had to build
up a ball team I’d start in by finding a good
catcher—if I could. There aren’t so many of
them, by jingo! And then I’d build up the team
around that catcher. Someone ought to grab
Craig about now and take him in hand. A man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
who knew how could make a fine backstop of that
fellow!”</p>

<p>“Why don’t you try it?” asked Mr. Scovill, with
a laugh.</p>

<p>“Not a bad idea,” replied Mr. York soberly.
“At least, I might put someone onto him. I
wouldn’t mind seeing him playing with Warner
in a year or two. Happen to know, Mr. Langham,
whether he has his college picked out?”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t. But”—and here Mr. Langham’s
eye twinkled—“there are three loyal Burton
men at my camp, and——”</p>

<p>“Help!” laughed Mr. York. “Nuf ced! Still,
if he did manage to escape you chaps I’d like a
chance at him. Suppose we walk down and see
them practise.”</p>

<p>Mr. Langham remained behind with Mr. Scovill,
at the latter’s request, to meet the Greenwood
party who were just then coming into sight
up the road, while one of the councillors was despatched
to the kitchen to see about a supply of
lemonade which Mr. Scovill had ordered to be
prepared and taken to the ball-ground. When
Mr. York and his companions reached the field
the visiting players had just started their practice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
and the audience had already begun to assemble.
The field was a fine, level expanse of
close turf about an eighth of a mile from the
camp, reached by a well-worn path through the
woods. The foul-lines and boxes had been freshly
marked out in honour of the event and the lime
shone dazzlingly in the sunlight. By degrees The
Wigwam boys gathered together at the farther
side of the diamond, making themselves comfortable
on the warm grass. Mr. Gifford and Steve
Brown were batting to infielders and outfielders
respectively, and Sam was at the plate, feeding the
balls to Mr. Gifford. The fellows went at practice
with plenty of snap and the ball fairly flew about
the bases. At ten minutes to three the visitors
yielded the field to the home team and at a few
minutes past the hour Mr. York called, “Play
ball!”</p>

<small>OUT AT THIRD!</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Had you looked over Will Temple’s shoulder
you’d have seen, very neatly set down in his
score-book—a brand-new one for the occasion—the
following batting orders of the rival camps:</p>

<p>The Wigwam—Brown, 2b.; Thursby, ss.; Meldrum,
rf.; Gifford, lf.; Groom, cf.; Crossbush, 3b.;
Murdock, 1b.; Craig, c.; Porter, p.</p>

<p>Mount Placid—Cochran, 1b.; Benson, ss.;
Smith, lf.; Walters, cf.; Connell, 3b.; Phillips, 2b.;
Hanford, c.; Williams, p.; Cather, rf.</p>

<p>At the last moment The Wigwam had thought
it best to put its full strength in the field at the
start, and so it was decided that Mr. Gifford
should take Peterson’s place in left. In that way
the line-up would contain the best batting talent.
In arranging the order of batting Mr. Gifford
started out on the assumption that Steve Brown
was the fastest man on bases and that, once on
first, he would be able to advance without aid.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
Consequently, Ed Thursby was to follow him,
since Ed, although not a hard hitter, was a fast
runner between bags. Meldrum was as good a
bunter as the team possessed, and Mr. Gifford was
placed fourth in the hope that he would be able
to score one or more of the preceding players.
Groom and Crossbush were fair hitters, while
Murdock was rather weak. Sam was to follow
the latter and, if possible, clean up. Porter was
the weak man at bat.</p>

<p>Of the Mount Placid team, Cochran, Connell,
Phillips, and Williams were councillors, although,
as The Wigwam learned afterwards, only Cochran
and Williams were players of experience.</p>

<p>Both teams showed nervousness in the first
inning or two and the play was rather ragged.
The Mount Placid fellows were at least a year
older than their rivals, all being, probably, over
sixteen, while the visiting boys were all under
that age, with one, Ralph Murdock, only fourteen.
Along the base-lines was assembled quite a good-sized
audience, representing Mount Placid, Greenwood,
and The Wigwam. Naturally enough, the
Greenwood fellows rooted for Mount Placid, and,
so far as cheering was concerned, The Wigwam<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
was bested from the start. Mount Placid, bunched
together some seventy strong behind the third
base-line, chanted: “Rah, rah rah! Who are we?
We are the boys of M. P. C.! Team! Team!
Team!” Greenwood, nearby, gave less often her,
“Greenwood! Greenwood! Greenwood! Rah, rah,
rah! Rah rah, rah! Greenwood!” The Wigwam,
still fewer in numbers, did its best under the leadership
of Dick Barry, and its novel cheer, short
and sharp, was applauded from across the diamond:
“W! Rah! I! Rah! G! Rah, rah, rah! W!
Rah! A! Rah! M! Rah, rah, rah! Wigwam!” In
spite of the fact that there were only some thirty
Wigwam supporters there, Dick Barry managed
to get excellent results.</p>

<p>Steve Brown started the game by striking out,
and Thursby and Meldrum were thrown out at
first. Mount Placid fared no better at bat. Cochran
flied to Mr. Gifford, Benson struck out, and
Smith made the third, Crossbush to Murdock. No
runs, and, so far, no errors. But the second inning
told a different tale. Mr. Gifford flied out to left
field and Groom fell victim to Mr. Williams’s slow
ball. And then, with two gone, the Mount Placid
third baseman fumbled an easy attempt of Tom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
Crossbush’s and that youth reached first. Murdock
received an in-shoot on the elbow and took
his base, briskly rubbing his arm. Then Sam,
cheered hopefully by The Wigwam boys, lined one
into deep centre and Crossbush reached the plate
a yard ahead of the ball and scored the first tally.
That gave the blue-shirted youths something to
celebrate, and Dick Barry didn’t let the opportunity
get by them. A minute later, however, the
inning was over, George Porter fanning.</p>

<p>There was no scoring in the last of the second
and none in either half of the third. In the latter
inning Mount Placid got to Porter for two singles,
but no one went beyond third. In the fourth it
looked for a while as if the visitors were going to
score again, for, with one down, Crossbush singled
sharply to left and went to second on Murdock’s
out, pitcher to first. Sam was again called on for
a hit, but this time Mr. Williams fooled him
badly and he struck out, and again Porter proved
easy. Mount Placid filled the bases in their
half, but George Porter, with one out, made Mr.
Cochran hit into a double, and once more The
Wigwam barked its cheer into the air.</p>

<p>The fifth began with the score still one to nothing,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
and Steve Brown tried desperately to get a
start. But the rival pitcher’s skill was too much
for Steve, and when, as a last resort, the latter got
in the way of the ball the thing was so palpable
that Mr. York laughingly shook his head and
Mount Placid jeered good-naturedly. Thursby
laid down a bunt in front of the plate, but he
couldn’t beat the throw to first. Meldrum made
the third out, short to first. The Mount Placid
shortstop, Benson, opened the inning for the home
team with a slow bunt down third-base line that
neither Crossbush nor Porter could field, and an
instant later he stole second, being aided by a
poor pitch of Porter’s that Sam couldn’t pick
from between his feet in time to throw.</p>

<p>Mount Placid, and Greenwood too, was cheering
lustily now, and the coachers were adding their
turmoil to the total of sound. With two strikes
and one ball on Smith, Porter let down and handed
out a base. With a man on first and second, Walters
flied out to Mr. Gifford, who held the runners.
Then Mr. Connell, one of the councillors, and third
baseman, found Porter for a long fly into right,
which George Meldrum badly misjudged, and two
runs trickled across. Mr. Connell took third on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
the throw-in. Mr. Phillips scored him a minute
later when he landed a Texas Leaguer behind first
base. There was still but one out. Sam walked
down and whispered to Porter. He had nothing
to say to the pitcher, for George was pitching
coolly and well, but he seemed to be planning all
sorts of strategies, and The Wigwam cheered and
the rivals indulged in the usual humourous remarks
held sacred to such occasions: “That’s
right, talk it over!” “Let’s all hear it!” “I’ll bet
it’s a good story!” “They’re changing the signals.
It’s all up now!” “Play ball, Wigwam!
Tell him about it afterwards!”</p>

<p>Mr. York cautioned Sam that he was taking
too much time, and Sam, nodding untroubledly,
donned his mask again and stooped behind Hanford,
the Mount Placid catcher. Hanford liked a
low ball and Sam saw that he didn’t get one. A
strike, breast-high, went over. Then an out-shoot
that might have been a strike or ball, and was
judged by the umpire as the latter. Then another
ball, much too high. Then a waister, that the
batter struck at and missed, was followed by a
foul. Sam, pulling his mask down again, laid one
finger against the back of his big mitt. Porter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
rubbed the back of his head reflectively and, had
anyone been regarding Steve Brown attentively,
he would have seen that player turn slightly toward
second base. Then Porter stepped forward
and the ball whizzed to the plate. It was one of
George’s fast, straight ones, and, while it actually
crossed the centre of the plate lower than Sam
wanted it to, it did the business. Hanford swung
too late and missed it by inches. It thumped into
Sam’s glove, was plucked forth instantly and sent,
fast and true, to second. Steve was already
awaiting it. Almost with one motion he caught
the throw, knee-high, and swept the ball to the
left. Mr. Phillips, sliding feet-first, was out by
a yard! And some thirty blue-shirted youths
cheered and capered!</p>

<p>But Mount Placid had a two-run lead now and
The Wigwam tried hard to cut it down in the
first half of the sixth. Mr. Gifford landed on a
straight ball and hit safely for two bases into far
left. Then Joe Groom fouled out to first baseman.
Crossbush fanned. With two out the inning
seemed over, but when Murdock knocked a slow
grounder across to third baseman that youth,
pausing to hold the runner at second, threw wide<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
to first and Murdock was safe. When, however,
a double steal was called for a few moments later,
Hanford proved too much for the success of the
venture. Although Sam swung at the ball, the
Mount Placid catcher side-stepped quickly and
plugged to third. The decision was a close one
and Sam looked sorrowfully at Mr. York when the
latter waved Mr. Gifford out. Mount Placid, too,
failed to get a runner across in that inning and
the seventh started with the score still 3 to 1.</p>

<p>Sam was up, having been left at bat in the
sixth, and Sam wanted desperately to start something!
But Mr. Williams had a slow ball that
he didn’t at all like. Twice Sam tried for it and
each time hit too soon. The first result was a
foul that third baseman narrowly missed and the
second a mighty swipe through empty air and a
loud and disgusted grunt from Sam. After that,
with two strikes and one ball against him, Sam
let two more go by and things looked brighter.
The next delivery was palpably bad and Sam,
dropping his bat, trotted to first amidst the acclaim
of The Wigwam boys, wishing that he had
Steve’s ability to purloin bases!</p>

<p>As it turned out, however, Sam was not called<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
on to steal. Mr. Williams at once set about trying
to catch him off his base. He apparently resented
that youth’s luck, and, as Sam thought,
even showed some temper in the vindictive way in
which he slammed the ball across to Mr. Cochran.
Sam each time took as much of a lead as he dared,
more than willing that the pitcher should throw
across. Five times Mr. Williams attempted to
surprise Sam and five times he failed, but always
by so narrow a margin that he was encouraged
to try it again. Then the pitcher disgustedly
turned his attention to Porter, who was impatiently
waiting at the plate, and Sam, watching
for a signal, poised himself on his toes.</p>

<p>The first ball pitched was too good to refuse and
Porter leaned against it. Off it travelled, straight
between first and second, and Sam, racing for the
next base, had to leap aside to avoid it. It was
too fast for handling by the infielders, although
second baseman made a gallant attempt, and Sam
reached third well ahead of the throw, while
George Porter, a much surprised youth, perched
himself on first. A minute later he was sent to
second and stole handily, Hanford being unwilling
to risk a throw-down for fear that Sam would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
score. The Wigwam supporters were now making
enough noise for twice their number, and even Mr.
Haskins was seen shouting himself red in the face.
Steve, who had sacrificed a strike when Porter
had gone to second, now tried hard to find something
he could hit. But Mr. Williams, after one
attempt to catch Porter at second, settled down
again and disposed of Steve with four deliveries,
and there was one gone. Ed Thursby tried
bravely to bring in a run, but only succeeded in
making the next out, second to first. Meldrum
was next in order, but Mr. Gifford, trusting to the
psychological effect of introducing a pinch-hitter,
called him back and sent Pete Simpson in to bat
for him. Simpson was no more of a hitter than
Meldrum, but that was something the opponents
couldn’t know. Nor did they know the new player’s
batting weakness as they now knew Meldrum’s.
Pete was a small youth, rather stocky,
and only fourteen years of age, and he didn’t
look especially formidable as he walked to the
plate and, with a somewhat nervous smile which
he strove to make appear confident, swung his
bat invitingly. Hanford experimented with a low
ball which Pete disdained and which went for a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
strike. Then came a slow one and Mr. York
called “Ball!” Pete knew what he wanted, but
Hanford hadn’t yet discovered it. As a matter of
fact, what Pete was wishing for was a plain,
every-day waister in the groove, which was about
the only sort of a ball he could hit! It didn’t look
as though he was to get one, though, for after
teasing him with another slow one which was
just too wide of the plate to be a strike, Mr.
Williams curved one over the outer corner and
the umpire announced “Strike two!”</p>

<p>“It only takes one, Pete!” called Tom Crossbush
from the bench. “Make him pitch to
you!”</p>

<p>Then Mr. Williams slipped a cog and what was
meant for a straight, slow ball went past well
over Steve’s shoulder and a howl of delight went
up from the bench.</p>

<p>“He’s got to put it over now!” called Mr. Gifford.
“Just tap it, Pete!”</p>

<p>Hanford glanced a bit nervously toward where
Sam was taking a ten-foot lead off third. Suddenly
the Mount Placid catcher became alarmed.
A hit meant two runs and a tied score! Beckoning
to Mr. Williams, he advanced halfway toward the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
box and the two consulted. This was the visitors’
chance to jibe and they took advantage of it.</p>

<p>“You’ve got them worried, Pete!” “Up in the
air, fellows! Here’s where we tie it up!” “Play
ball! Play ball!”</p>

<p>The coachers added their contributions, while
Sam, dancing about at third, seriously interfered
with the conversation between Mr. Williams and
Hanford by threatening to steal home every instant.
Finally the Mount Placid battery returned
to their places and Hanford knelt and gave his
signal, or pretended to. What followed was a
pitch-out, a quick peg to the pitcher by Hanford
and an equally speedy throw to third, and Sam,
two yards from base, was caught flat-footed for
the third out!</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV</a><br />
<small>TIED IN THE EIGHTH</small></h2>
</div>


<p>The Wigwam was quiet and disappointed while
the teams changed places. From across the diamond
came the applauding cheers of the enemy.
Sam, thoroughly disgusted with himself, donned
protector and mask in grim silence. Joe Groom,
who had been coaching at third, generously strove
to take the blame.</p>

<p>“That was my fault, sir! I ought to have known
they were up to some silly trick!”</p>

<p>“No one’s fault but mine,” replied Sam decisively.
“I played it like an idiot!”</p>

<p>Benson went to bat for the home team in the last
of the seventh and cracked out a two-bagger over
shortstop and was caught off second a minute or
two later by a quick return from Sam to Porter,
who whirled instantly and pegged to Thursby.
The Wigwam recovered from its gloom and
cheered. Then the Mount Placid left fielder
fouled out to Sam and two were gone. But the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
inning was not yet over, for Walters, a thin,
freckled-faced youth with extraordinarily long
legs, took it into his head to bunt, after once trying
to knock the cover off the ball, and caught
Crossbush napping. By the time Tom had gathered
in the rolling ball and sent it to first Walters
was making the turn. Mr. Connell was up next,
and, profiting by Walters’ example, he laid the
sphere down a few feet from the plate and lit out
for the base like a runaway horse. By the time
Sam had dashed his mask aside, got the ball and
pegged to Murdock, the runner was safe and Walters
was on second, and the grey shirts and the
green shirts were shouting madly.</p>

<p>Mr. Phillips, the next batter, had one hit to his
credit and, as Sam had discovered, liked a low ball.
So Porter fed him high ones and got two strikes
and one ball on his. Then came a foul and a second
strike. Porter wasted one then and the score
was two and two. Sam called for a fast one and
Porter tried it. Unfortunately, Mr. Phillips outguessed
him and when the ball came along he met
it squarely for a long fly into left. Mr. Gifford
was after it like a shot, but he had to run back a
dozen yards and when he finally got his hand on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
it he failed to hold it. The best he could do was
to recover quickly and throw to third in time to
hold the second runner there. Walters scored and
the game stood 4 to 1. With runners on second
and third, things still looked dubious for The
Wigwam, and Porter made them more so by
utterly failing to locate the plate with the first
three deliveries! Hanford, who was up, swung
his bat and stepped back and forth in the box.
Sam signalled a straight ball and got it for a
strike. Hanford let it go past unchallenged, for
he had two more chances and was waiting for the
last one. Again Porter essayed a fast one in the
groove, but this time he failed and Mr. York
waved Hanford to first. The bases filled, Mount
Placid cheered exultantly and the grey-shirted
coachers danced and yelped; and the base-runners
too did their level best to rattle the pitcher.</p>

<p>Mr. Williams was at bat now and Sam had what
he would have called a “hunch” to the effect that
Mr. Williams was dangerous at this stage of
affairs. While Porter sent the first delivery in, a
curve that failed to win approval from Mr. York,
Sam studied the runners on the bases. At third,
Walters was taking a good lead on the wind-up,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
but hugging the bag safely at other times. On
second Mr. Connell was watching the baseman
carefully in spite of his seeming recklessness. At
first, though, Hanford, feeling safe from attack,
was leading a good twelve feet. Sam tossed the
ball back to Porter.</p>

<p>“Keep after him, George!” he called. Then he
stooped, dropped his mitt between his knees, and
gave the signal. But it was a closed fist that
Porter saw, and that called for a throw-out. Porter
walked to the side of the box, picked up an
imaginary pebble and tossed it away. Then he
tugged at his cap, wound up and sped the ball
four feet wide of the batsman and straight into
Sam’s waiting mitt. One step forward toward
first, a quick throw, and the trick was won!
Frantic shouts of warning from coachers, a desperate
slide to the bag by Hanford, a scurry for
the plate by Walters! But Murdock had been
ready. At the instant the ball had settled in Sam’s
mitt he had run toward the bag. The throw was
perfect and Murdock caught it, fell to one knee
and let Hanford slide into the ball as he tried for
safety!</p>

<p>The shouts of delight came from the third-base<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
side of the field, for across the diamond a dense silence
reigned. Sam and Ralph Murdock received
an ovation as they returned to the bench. Mr. Gifford
slapped Sam on the back and many of the
boys would have followed suit had they dared.
Pandemonium reigned until Mr. York called,
“Batter up, please!” When Sam, passing the
plate to reach the coacher’s box at first, went by
him the umpire smiled as he said softly: “Quick
work, Craig!”</p>

<p>Four to one now and only two innings left! The
Wigwam realised the fact that if the game was
to be pulled out of the fire, and they had by no
means given up hope yet, something must be done
now, that it wouldn’t do to count on a ninth-inning
rally. And so they went at the task very determinedly,
very carefully. Mr. Gifford, the first
man up, showed no eagerness to hit. Instead he
allowed Mr. Williams to put a strike and two balls
over before he made his first attempt. Then he
swung and a foul-tip resulted. At two-and-two
Mr. Williams chose to try a curve and, since the
batter refused to be deceived by it, put himself in
the hole. Amidst a strained silence Mr. Williams
wound up again and sent in one of his deceptive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
slow balls. But Mr. Gifford had profited by experience,
and guessed what was coming. The
result was that he hit slowly and caught the offering
fairly a foot from the end of his bat and the
ball went arching gaily and gracefully into centre
field and Mr. Gifford went speeding quite as gaily—if
not so gracefully—to first base. That hit, for
it was a hit, landed untouched between centre
fielder and shortstop, with second baseman just
out of the running. It was the fielder who scooped
up the rolling ball and set himself for the throw
to second. Unfortunately for him, however, second
base was for the moment uncovered. Mr.
Williams and Mr. Gifford arrived there simultaneously
an instant later, but by that time the
centre fielder saw no reason for throwing!</p>

<p>That was a fine opening for the inning, and no
mistake! And The Wigwam jumped and shouted
and pounded each other’s backs and barked out
their cheer. And Steve Brown scuttled to third
and shouted himself hoarse in the desperate attempt
to upset Mr. Williams’ coolness; desperate,
since the Mount Placid pitcher was not easily
rattled.</p>

<p>Joe Groom went to the plate looking determined,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
but only succeeded in flying out to shortstop.
Tom Crossbush managed to reach first on
a scratch-hit past third baseman. Murdock struck
out miserably. The Wigwam’s hopes began to
dim. But with Sam up something might yet happen
to their liking, and so they cheered him encouragingly
and held their breaths while Mr.
Williams did his utmost to put him out of the way.</p>

<p>A strike—a ball—another ball, by a scant margin—a
foul-strike! Sam watched and waited,
gripping his bat tightly, and looking as cool as
if the outcome of the game might not depend on
the next delivery. Perhaps Sam’s confidence affected
Mr. Williams. At least it is probable that
the Mount Placid pitcher never intended to send
across just what he did, for the ball came up to
Sam with nothing on it but the cover and Sam
smote it lustily and thirty-odd youths sprang
into the air and shrieked deliriously!</p>

<p>Around the bases sped Mr. Gifford, his flannel
trousers a grey streak above the turf, and behind
him came Tom Crossbush. Off for first leaped
Sam, while, far out in right field, the ball was
leisurely descending to earth. Eight fielder was
sprinting desperately toward the fence that enclosed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
the ground on that side. If only, prayed
the Wigwam supporters, that ball would land on
the other side! But it didn’t. It came down a
dozen feet inside the boundary, and Cather, with
a final plucky spurt, shot his hand into the air
and—well, then fielder and ball went down together
and rolled over! There was one breathless
instant of uncertainty, broken by the triumphant
yells of The Wigwam when Cather, scrambling
to his feet, searched the turf hurriedly, recovered
the ball and made a wretched throw to
second baseman. At that moment Mr. Gifford was
trotting across the plate, Tom Crossbush was past
third, and Sam was rounding second. Second
baseman sped the ball home, but too late to catch
Tom, and Hanford desperately pegged it to third.
But Sam reached the bag just as the ball did and
had one scuffed shoe snuggled against it when
Mr. Connell tagged him none too gently.</p>

<p>Four to three now! Only one run needed to
tie! Two out, but a man on third! If only Porter
could make good! Mr. Gifford consulted Thursby
and The Wigwam waited anxiously. Then a cheer
went up, for Peterson was off the bench and pawing
at the bats! Porter was coming out! Peterson<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
was to bat for him! A hit would tie the
game!</p>

<p>Dan Peterson received a veritable ovation as
he hurried to the plate. He was loudly invited to
contribute a hit, a two-bagger, a home run! To
bust it! To tear the cover off! To—to——</p>

<p>Then quiet returned, or, rather, comparative
quiet, for the coachers had no intention of letting
up on their babel. From back of first base Joe
Groom shouted at the top of his lungs to Sam on
third, and back of Sam Mr. Gifford clapped his
hands and added to the noise. And then Mr.
Williams brought down upon himself ridicule and
wrath by deliberately passing Peterson! The
Wigwam was incensed indeed! Mount Placid and
Greenwood, however, laughed and applauded, and
Peterson, deprived of the chance to distinguish
himself as a pinch-hitter, scowled darkly at Mr.
Williams as he walked unwillingly to base.</p>

<p>Steve Brown was up then, and Steve had played
in hard luck all day. Not once had he been able to
get to first. This rankled in Steve’s breast, and
as he faced the Mount Placid pitcher he resolved
that this time, his last opportunity, he would not
be foiled! On the first ball pitched Peterson<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
legged it for second and Sam danced forward halfway
along the base line toward home. But Hanford
knew better than to risk a throw to second
and contented himself with a motion that sent Sam
scuttling back to third. Steve had offered at the
delivery and so had one strike on him. To bring
in a run he must hit safely and Steve waited his
chance. But before it came something happened.</p>

<p>On second Peterson, perhaps disgruntled at the
trick worked on him, was set on showing his contempt
for the enemy by risking a lead that simply
cried for punishment. On each wind-up he
went fully half the distance to third. Now Hanford
was canny enough, but that was too great a
temptation for him to resist. And so he gave a
signal, Mr. Williams turned quickly, stepped out
and shot the ball to shortstop. Peterson was
twelve feet off base and there was but one thing to
do and that was to keep away from the ball long
enough for Sam to score. So he set out toward
third and Sam looked on and watched his chance.
It came when shortstop tossed the ball over Peterson’s
head to third baseman. Then Sam set out
desperately. And that, of course, was what Hanford
wanted. Third baseman turned and pegged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
to the plate while Sam was still ten feet away.
But, alas for Hanford’s hopes! The ball slammed
into the dust and, although he tried desperately
to get it, he failed, and while he was still groping
for it with one hand and striving to block off Sam
with his body that youth slid to safety in a cloud
of red dust and Peterson romped to third!</p>

<p>Mount Placid listened gloomily to the visitors’
wild outpouring of joy, saw them drag the runner
to his feet and pull him ecstatically to the bench,
saw Hanford, rather pale and wrathful, slap the
dust from his clothes, recover his mask, and disspiritedly
send the ball back to Mr. Williams; saw,
too, Mr. Connell on third trying his best to look
as if he didn’t know he had thrown the game
away!</p>

<p>“W! Rah! I! Rah! G! Rah, rah, rah! W! Rah!
A! Rah! M! Rah, rah, rah! Wigwam! Wigwam!!
Wigwa-a-arm!!!” And Dick Barry cavorting
about like a thing built of springs, waving his arms
and kicking his legs and shouting his voice away!
And the score 4 to 4, and everyone on the third
base side very, very happy and noisy!</p>

<p>And then, after a minute, when one more run
might have given the visitors the victory, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
Steve had still another strike to be scored against
him, Peterson, made careless by his previous good
fortune, took just that extra inch forbidden by
safety—and the coacher—and slid back to the
bag too late!</p>

<p>That was disappointing, but there was another
inning, and if only they could keep Mount Placid
from adding to her score; and could themselves
put just one other little tally across——</p>

<p>And so Mount Placid went to bat for her half
of the eighth looking firmly resolved to do or die,
and Mr. Gifford, pulling a pitcher’s glove on,
stepped into the box to do his best. Peterson took
the councillor’s place in left field, Peterson rather
chastened in spirit now. Mr. Williams, first batter,
was an easy victim to the infield, going out at
first, Steve to Murdock, and Cather followed him,
the assist going to Tom Crossbush. That brought
the head of the Mount Placid list up, and Mr.
Cochran had a fearsome glint in his eye as he
faced the substitute pitcher. Mr. Gifford’s offerings
were not very baffling and the rival first
baseman landed on the second delivery and sent
it speeding down the alley between shortstop and
third. One base was all he got, however, for Joe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
Groom, running in like a streak, fielded prettily
to second. Then Benson followed with a hit past
third and Mount Placid had runners on first and
second. But the danger was over a moment later
when Smith, lifting a long fly to the outfield, saw
it settle cosily into Simpson’s hands.</p>

<p>Then it was the ninth, with Steve Brown up
and only one run needed. Steve and Mr. Gifford
and Ed Thursby consulted a minute ere Steve
stepped to the plate. “You’ve got to get your
base somehow, Steve,” said Mr. Gifford. “Think
you can hit him?” Steve looked doubtful.</p>

<p>“I’m going to make an awful try,” he said
grimly.</p>

<p>“Maybe if you can get him in a hole——” began
Ed.</p>

<p>“Bunt,” said Mr. Gifford. “That’s your best
chance. Swing like fury on one and then watch
for a good one and just hold your bat in front
of it. If you connect, run like the dickens, Steve!”</p>

<p>“If I should get to first don’t you sacrifice, Ed.
Make the bluff, but don’t swing. That fellow
Hanford’s slow on throwing-down and I can beat
him easily.”</p>

<p>“Batter up!” called Mr. York.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV</a><br />
<small>STEVE SCORES</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Mr. Williams motioned the infielders in and
Steve’s hopes dropped. Evidently the pitcher was
looking for an attempt at a bunt. At all events,
Steve’s chance of “getting away with it,” as
he mentally phrased it, seemed pretty slim. He
wished he could manage to lay against the ball
just hard enough to carry it out of the diamond,
since, with the infielders all inside the base lines,
a short, low fly would be the safest sort of a hit.
But it was soon evident that Mr. Williams had
no idea of letting him so much as touch that ball!
The Mount Placid pitcher was never more deliberate
or careful. The first offering went as a
ball and the second looked low, but was called a
strike by Mr. York. Mr. Gifford and Sam were
shouting encouragingly. “Hit it out, Steve!”
“Choose your alley!” “All the way ’round this
time, Steve!” Mr. Williams studied the catcher’s
signal very attentively, hesitated, shook his head,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
looked again, nodded, wound up, and pitched. The
ball broke to the right and Steve stepped warily
back only to realise the next instant that the
sphere had crossed the inner corner of the plate
and to hear the umpire fatefully announce,
“Strike—two!”</p>

<p>Steve glared wrathfully at the pitcher as that
gentleman again settled the ball between his fingers,
and tried to guess what the next one was
to be. With two strikes against him, it was probable
that Mr. Williams would waste one, but
Steve wasn’t certain and so, when the dirty-white
sphere again shot toward him, he glued his eyes to
it and in the scant moment of time that elapsed
tried his hardest to judge it. Then he brought
his bat around, there was a slight tingle in his
hands and he was sprinting toward first. But
luck was still against him, for the discouraging
cry of “Foul!” caught him halfway along the
path, and he turned back, picked up his bat, and
again faced the pitcher. Steve was hopeless now,
and a little desperate. The absurd notion of striking
at the next delivery, no matter what it might
be, and so ending the suspense, came to him, and
he dallied with it while Mr. Williams, slowly and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
deliberately, wound-up, stepped forward, and shot
the ball once more toward the plate. And then
Steve found himself suddenly undecided, quite
lost sight of the ball for an instant, found it again
just as it came close, brought his bat around half-heartedly
in a despairing effort which he was
perfectly certain was a hopeless one, and then
felt the shock of bat and ball, heard the sudden
shriek that went up from behind him and, digging
his toes into the dust, put his head down
and raced!</p>

<p>That hit was the joke of the game. The ball
would have crossed the outer corner of the plate
at about a level with the top of Steve’s shoes had
he allowed it to. Hanford had dropped to his
knees to get it, and whether Hanford or Steve
was the more surprised is hard to say. The latter’s
ridiculous swing had, by some stroke of luck,
caught the ball on the tip of the bat. There had
been no force in the swing, Steve had even failed
to grasp the stick firmly, but the result could have
been no more satisfactory had he studied and
worked for it, for that ball arose from almost in
the dust and described a pretty arch over the
pitcher’s head and descended fifteen feet behind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
the base line, and a little to the right of second.
Second baseman tried for it desperately, and first
baseman went to his assistance, but the hit was
never in danger of being caught. Had the second
baseman been playing his usual position he would
only have had to step back a couple of yards and
put his hand up to have caught it, but with that
player well inside the diamond the ball was quite
safe. And so was Steve, one toe poised on first
base and a look of deep surprise on his countenance.
Mr. Gifford was slapping him on the back
and saying, for the sole benefit of the enemy:
“No one out, Steve! Play it safe and look out
for a double!”</p>

<p>At the plate Ed Thursby faced the pitcher and
gave an excellent imitation of a man wanting to
bunt. Steve took a six-foot lead. Mr. Williams
turned. Steve slid back to base. The ball slapped
into first baseman’s mitt. The Wigwam scoffed
loudly. Once more the pitcher tried, but Steve
was like a cat for quickness. Mr. Williams turned
his attention then to the batter and Steve edged
further away and watched the wind-up and reckoned
his chance. Ed Thursby showed how eager
he was to hit by stepping almost on top of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
plate to get that delivery, and, apparently, only
failing to swing because it was palpably a pitch-out.
Hanford, getting the ball, recovered quickly
and looked more than surprised when he saw that
Steve had made no attempt to steal! One ball to
Ed’s credit then. Steve again took his lead
and Mr. Williams studied him a moment in deep
silence ere he turned back, took a short wind up
and——</p>

<p>“<em>There he goes!</em>” shouted the first baseman.</p>

<p>Ed never even so much as offered at that ball,
but you may be sure he didn’t step out of the
way! Hanford side-stepped, shot his arm back
and then forward and off sailed the ball to second
base. It reached there in a cloud of dust, and
shortstop, covering base, made a brilliant catch
and swung downward. But Steve had one foot
hooked into the bag and was smiling sweetly as
Mr. York, trotting by, spread his hands wide,
palms downward. The Wigwam cheered and
capered. Then Steve was up again, patting dust
from his grey trousers and edging along the path
toward third. Twice shortstop circled behind him
to base, but Mr. Williams refused to throw. There
was not in his estimation any danger of the runner<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
stealing third with no one out. Besides, he
was already in difficulty with the batsman, for
his second delivery had been far too high and
the score was two balls and no strikes. Ed
Thursby suddenly recovered from his fierce desire
to hit. He stood idle while Mr. Williams put
a fast ball over for a strike and while he tried
to do it again and missed it by an inch or two.
One-and-two, then, and Mr. Williams showing
some discomfort, and the rival coachers making
life hideous with their shouts. But the Mount
Placid pitcher took plenty of time; cast a look
toward Steve, dancing challengingly about on the
base path, sent him hurrying back to second with
a none too fast throw to the second baseman, got
the ball back, fixed it between his fingers, and
finally sent it in.</p>

<p>“Strike—two!” said Mr. York.</p>

<p>Ed only smiled. There was still another chance
and this time the offering must be good. His
glance shot across to Steve while the ball was
returned. Whatever he did, he reflected, he must
not put the ball into the infield where it could be
played to third, for he knew perfectly well that
Steve meant to steal on the next delivery. And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
then the ball was coming and he set his body for
it. And as it came bedlam was let loose!</p>

<p>“Third! Third! There he goes!” shrieked
Mount Placid. For Steve was off with the
wind-up, his legs fairly twinkling along the path.
Around came Ed’s bat, the ball thumped into Hanford’s
glove and, an instant later, flew through
the air to third. But once more Steve had stolen
cleanly, ending his sprint with a ten-foot fallaway
slide! And again The Wigwam jubilated
riotously! Ed Thursby, trailing his bat back to
the pile, reflected that even if he had been
ingloriously struck out the day was not yet
lost.</p>

<p>Simpson had his instructions to bunt, if he
could, along the first-base line. Mr. Williams
again signalled the infield to close in toward the
plate, for they must play for the man on third no
matter what became of the batter. Simpson tried
hard to carry out instructions, missed one strike,
fouled off a second and, finally, with two strikes
and two balls on him, actually bumped the sphere
across the diamond in a very good imitation of a
hit. But it was an imitation only and he would
have been an easy out had not Benson, the opposing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
shortstop, delayed too long to throw to first.
Benson was so sure that the runner on third was
putting out for home that it took him several
valuable moments to convince himself that that
player was actually only ten feet from base. By
that time Simpson, who could run if he couldn’t
bat much, was almost at the bag, and Benson’s
desperate peg failed to get him.</p>

<p>Mount Placid showed signs of nervousness now.
Mr. Gifford went to bat. On the first pitch Simpson
scuttled to second. Hanford threw quickly
to the box, but Steve was not to be fooled by so
ancient a trick and trotted back to third. There
was no necessity for taking risks, anyway, for
there was but one down and any sort of a hit or a
long sacrifice fly would score him. But five minutes
later the outlook was darker, for Mr. Gifford, in
spite of all his efforts, only managed at last to
hit straight at the box. Mr. Williams knocked
the ball down, held Steve at third, and tossed out
the runner. The Wigwam, almost pale with excitement,
groaned and cheered together. The
rivals across the diamond found cause for rejoicing
and shouted encouragingly.</p>

<p>Joe Groom picked out a bat and faced the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
pitcher, scowling intently. At second Simpson
took a long lead, but watched the ball closely. On
third Steve had grown suddenly shy and hugged
the bag until the ball was in the air. But the
coachers kept up their din and the infield still
played short-field and Mr. Williams looked a little
bit anxious. The first offer was a straight ball
right across the plate and Joe Groom frowned.
The next was wide and evened the score. Then
a curve fooled Joe completely and his vicious
swing at it passed harmlessly by.</p>

<p>“Two-and-one!” called Hanford hoarsely.
“Let’s have him now!”</p>

<p>Mr. Williams smiled grimly, began his wind-up
and—faltered! For there, running like a grey-legged
rabbit along the path, sped Steve! Mr.
Williams recovered quickly, stepped forward and
shot the ball to Hanford. Some two hundred
voices shrieked together. Joe Groom held his
place grimly, his eyes fixed on the ball, his bat
poised. But there was no need of offering, for
that one instant of hesitation had done the business.
The ball, sent away as an out-curve, broke
wildly, and although Hanford, dropping to his
knees, threw himself in the way of it, it trickled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
past, and Steve, sliding to the plate in a maelstrom
of dust, had scored!</p>

<p>Joe and half a dozen others lifted him to his
feet. Above the outburst of joy from the third-base
side of the diamond could be heard Mr. Gifford’s
reiterated ejaculation of “You old thief!
You old thief!” Off to the bench they hustled
him, shaking his hand, thumping his back. Down
at first base Ed Thursby was trying hard to stand
on his head and wave his legs. Behind third Sam
was absolutely grinning!</p>

<p>And then, order restored again, Joe Groom
stood idly by and watched Mr. Williams put two
balls past, and then walked to first.</p>

<p>“Let’s have a couple more!” shouted Thursby.
“We’ve got ’em going, fellows! Let’s——”</p>

<p>But the rest was drowned in the cheer that Dick
Barry was leading. But, although Ed took second
unchallenged on a passed ball, Tom Crossbush
failed to deliver the required hit, popping a
miserable little foul to Hanford, and the side was
out.</p>

<p>Five to four was the score now, and “Hold
’em!” pleaded The Wigwam supporters. “Hold
’em!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span></p>

<p>Walters, Connell, and Phillips were up for
Mount Placid in that last of the ninth, and Mr.
Gifford was a victim to dire forebodings as he
stepped into the pitcher’s box. Nothing he possessed,
he felt sure, would deceive the two councillors,
and so it was up to the fielders to hold the
game safe. Walters was far too anxious and
nervous and put himself to the bad at once by
fouling the first two deliveries. Then, growing
cautious, he misjudged the next ball and stepped
aside.</p>

<p>“One gone!” called Sam. “Here’s the next
victim, Andy!”</p>

<p>But Mr. Connell was not so easy. He lighted
on Mr. Gifford’s second offering and poked it
well into left for two bases, to the great joy of
Mount Placid. A hit now would tie the game
again. Sam called for high ones and Mr. Gifford
tried his best to send them in that way. But
he didn’t always succeed, and with one strike and
two balls he unfortunately gave Mr. Phillips just
what that gentleman fancied. There was a sharp
<em>crack</em> and off into short right sped the ball. On
second Mr. Connell poised himself to start the
instant the ball landed. And start he did, and run<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
he did! Down came the ball into Simpson’s glove
after that youth had run halfway to the infield,
and Simpson, putting on brakes, made the throw
that saved the day. Sam, astride the plate, hands
outstretched, waited anxiously. Along the path
from third raced the ambitious Mr. Connell. The
air was filled with unintelligible cries and noises.
Then the ball struck the sod well in front of the
plate, bounded straight and thudded into Sam’s
hands, and Sam, dropping to his left knee, thrust
it against Mr. Connell’s oncoming foot, toppled
over on the runner, rolled over and aside and held
a hand aloft, the ball still firmly clasped!</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” asked Steve Brown, as,
helping Sam to his feet, he heard the latter groan.</p>

<p>“I twisted my knee,” muttered Sam, testing his
right leg and flinching as he put his weight on it.
“Threw it out of joint, I guess, when he slid into
me. It will be all right in a minute.”</p>

<p>“Here, come over to the bench and sit down. I’ll
rub it for you. Hold on, fellows! Mr. Craig’s
hurt his knee. Don’t crowd around, please.”</p>

<p>“What’s that?” demanded Mr. Langham’s
voice. “Sam Craig hurt?” The Chief pushed
his way to the bench where Steve was already
briskly massaging the injured limb. “Anything
broken, Sam?” he asked anxiously.</p>

<p>“No, sir, not a thing. I just slipped my knee
out of place and it’s sort of sore. It will be all
right in a minute, I think.”</p>

<p>“Better come up to the camp,” said Mr. Scovill,
who had followed Mr. Langham. “We can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
help you up there and then you can get your things
off and put some cold water on it. You can hobble
up if we give you a lift, can’t you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, thanks. Don’t bother, please. It’s
all right. Did anyone pick up my mask?”</p>

<p>“I got it,” said Tom Crossbush. “I don’t know
what became of the ball, though. Did you drop it,
Mr. Craig?”</p>

<p>Sam smiled a little and held out one hand, and
the others laughed, for there was the battered
ball, very tightly clenched. Sam yielded it then,
allowed Steve to unbuckle his protector and, between
Steve and Mr. Gifford, followed the throng
up the hill. Mount Placid had cheered The Wigwam
and The Wigwam had cheered its defeated
host; and Greenwood had impartially cheered
both. And now, talking excitedly, explaining,
laughing, the boys were climbing the path to camp.
Mr. York joined the “ambulance corps,” as he
called it, and expressed regrets for Sam’s injury.</p>

<p>“I know what it’s like,” he said as he walked
alongside. “I used to have a way of putting my
wrist out of joint every little while when I was a
youngster, and I still remember just how nasty it
felt when it slipped into place again and how sore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
the muscles used to be afterwards. A cold compress
is what you want, Craig, and then, to-morrow,
a good rubbing with liniment. Better not
try to walk on it for a day or so, though.”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid I’ll have to,” responded Sam cheerfully.
“You see, we’re going on to-morrow morning,
Mr. York. Going to hike back to Indian
Lake.”</p>

<p>“I guess you won’t do much hiking,” was the
reply.</p>

<p>“Certainly not,” confirmed Mr. Langham.
“We’ll put it off a day. That is——” He stopped
and frowned. “Well, we’ll talk about it later.”</p>

<p>“I think I’ll be all right by morning, Chief,”
said Sam.</p>

<p>“We’ll see, we’ll see, Sam. Mr. York, I want
to thank you, sir, for the service you performed
for us. It was very kind of you, very kind indeed.
And I don’t believe anyone could have umpired
more—er—more impartially, sir.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I enjoyed it,” answered Mr. York, with a
jovial laugh. “You couldn’t have kept me away
if you’d tried. By the way, Mr. Langham——”</p>

<p>The two dropped behind and remained in conversation
until the camp was reached. Sam was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
taken over to the dormitory where the visitors
were to sleep and, Steve and Mr. Langham assisting,
got out of his clothes and had a wet bandage
wrapped around his knee. The knee was swollen
and lame, and Mr. Gifford shook his head over it.</p>

<p>“It will feel a lot better to-morrow, Sam,” he
said, “but you’ll not be able to do much walking
inside of a couple of days, I’m afraid.”</p>

<p>“I’ll make out somehow,” replied Sam. “You
needn’t think you’re going to do me out of my
fun.”</p>

<p>“A lot of fun you’d have,” said Steve grimly.
“Best thing for you to do is to stay right here for
another day and then catch up with us by train.
We won’t make more than fifteen miles to-morrow,
I guess.”</p>

<p>“Well, if it isn’t all right, I suppose I’ll have
to,” answered Sam regretfully. “I don’t quite
see how I managed to do such a fool stunt.”</p>

<p>“The Chief said something about waiting another
day,” remarked Mr. Gifford, “but I’m
afraid he can’t do that. In the first place, we’re
putting a lot of these chaps out of their beds—some
of them are sleeping on the floor in the other
dormitories; and in the second place, if we’re to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
get back in time to get ready for Visitors’ Day we
can’t afford to lose much time.”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t want him to wait on my account,”
said Sam. “If I can’t go with you to-morrow I’ll
catch up the next day. Hang the luck, anyway!”</p>

<p>“Never mind,” said Steve soothingly. “You
made a peach of a catch, Sam, and we beat ’em!”
Just then Mr. Collins and Mr. Williams entered
to tell Sam how sorry they were, Mr. Collins expressing
the fear that the injury was his fault.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid I went into you pretty hard,” he
said. “Awfully sorry. About all I was thinking
of was beating out that ball!”</p>

<p>“It wasn’t any fault of yours, sir,” Sam assured
him. “Somehow in trying to get the ball on
you I gave my leg a twist. I—I’m sorry we
couldn’t both win that game.”</p>

<p>“That’s all right. The Chief has promised to
take us down to call on you fellows next summer.
Then look out for us!”</p>

<p>“We’ll be mighty glad to see you,” said Mr.
Gifford. “I’m afraid we can’t treat you as handsomely
as you have us, Mr. Collins, but we’ll do
our best; even to beating you again, if possible!”</p>

<p>“We’ll see about that,” Mr. Williams laughed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
“You chaps certainly played a good game, though,
and you deserved to win. Mr. Craig, you’d better
stay right here with us until that knee’s all right.
We’ll look after you finely.”</p>

<p>“I heard the Chief say that Mr. York had invited
Mr. Craig down to his place,” said Mr.
Collins. “You’d better go, Mr. Craig. He’s got a
mighty comfortable house down there and I guess
he’d be able to give you rather a better bed than
we can.”</p>

<p>“Why, I—I guess I’d just as lief stay here,”
murmured Sam, “if you don’t mind having me.
I’m hoping, though, that I’ll be all right to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“Well, if you’re not we’ll be glad to have you
stay here as long as you care to. I’ll see that you
have some supper sent over. And if there’s anything
else you can think of—How about having a
doctor look at that knee, Mr. Gifford? There’s
one a couple of miles from here and I can get
him on the ’phone in a minute.”</p>

<p>“What do you say, Sam?” asked Mr. Gifford.
Sam shook his head decisively.</p>

<p>“No, indeed, thanks! It’s quite all right now.
And I don’t think you need to send my supper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
here. I guess I can hobble over to the dining-hall
without trouble.”</p>

<p>“Better not try it,” said Mr. Collins. “Rest
up to-night and you’ll feel better for it to-morrow.”</p>

<p>So Sam made the best of it where he was. The
knee ached dully, but didn’t worry him much as
long as he kept it quiet. Mr. Williams loaded
him with magazines and papers and for an hour
and more he lay there and read and listened to
the sounds that came from outside. Now and
then one of the boys would tiptoe in to express
embarrassed regrets. He heard the cheers that
were exchanged when Greenwood started back to
camp, and, later, the sound of voices as The Wigwam
boys trooped past to supper. Steve appeared
a few minutes after that with a well-laden
tray, and, when he had changed the bandage on
the injured knee, helped Sam into a sitting position
and placed the tray before him. Sam discovered
that his appetite was excellent and that
the supper, generous as it was, was none too much
to satisfy it.</p>

<p>The light was too dim now to read by, so, setting
the tray on the floor, he straightened out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
and fell to thinking about things. He went over
the afternoon’s game again and, which was like
him, viewed his own work critically and pointed out
to himself the mistakes he had made. There was
that time, for instance, when he had been caught
flat-footed off third. Sam grunted disgustedly as
he recalled the incident. Then, too, he had more
than once failed to work the batter right. That
bunt of Mr. Collins’ in the sixth inning—or had
it been the seventh?—should never have been allowed
him. And then——</p>

<p>But at that moment there were voices outside
and then footsteps on the porch and Mr. Langham
and York came in. After inquiring about
the knee, Mr. Langham said:</p>

<p>“Sam, Mr. York here wants to kidnap you.”</p>

<p>Sam smiled a little doubtfully, inquiringly.</p>

<p>“Yes, Craig,” said the second visitor, “I want
to take you down to my place until you get ready
to join your crowd. I’ve got lots of room down
there; half a dozen bedrooms standing idle, in
fact. Of course, Mr. Scovill will be glad to have
you stay here if you’d rather, but I fancy you’ll
be a lot more comfortable with me. I’ve spoken
to him about it and he says I can have you. And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
Mr. Langham’s agreed, too. Now what do you
say?”</p>

<p>“Why—thank you very much,” stammered
Sam, “but I guess I won’t bother you. I dare say
that by morning this knee will be all right. I’d
like to start with the others if I could, sir.” The
latter part of the remark was addressed to Mr.
Langham.</p>

<p>“Of course, Sam, but it would be silly for you
to try any walking just yet. You’d be so lame
to-morrow night you might have to lie up longer
than you will now. And I’m afraid there’d be no
place to stay. You do just as you like about visiting
Mr. York, but, in any case, don’t consider
going with us in the morning. I’d wait a day for
you, but it would make us pretty late in getting
home. You keep still for a day or two and then
join us by train. I’ve written down the route
here and our probable location the day after to-morrow
and the day after that. If you shouldn’t
feel fit enough to join us before Monday, why,
you come right back to camp. Maybe you’d better
do that, anyhow, Sam, and not try walking.”</p>

<p>“I’d rather do part of the trip with you, anyway,
if I can, sir. And I should think that if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
I kept quiet to-morrow I’d ought to be able to meet
you the next day.”</p>

<p>“Suit yourself. We’ll be glad to see you when
you come. Meanwhile, if I were you I’d accept
Mr. York’s offer. He’s got his car here and I
guess we can fix you so it won’t hurt much.”</p>

<p>“He’s very kind,” faltered Sam, not over-enthusiastically.
Mr. York laughed.</p>

<p>“Don’t come if you’d rather not, Craig,” he
said. “I only thought it would be easier for you
and a pleasure for me. If you’d rather stay here,
don’t hesitate. I’ll run up to-morrow and see
how you are.”</p>

<p>“It would be an awful bother for you, sir,”
said Sam.</p>

<p>“Not a bit of bother, old man! I’d be plaguey
glad to have you. We could talk baseball to our
heart’s content. And there are one or two things
I’d like to tell you about.” Mr. Langham chuckled
softly and Mr. York turned to him with a laugh.
“Not that at all, Mr. Langham! Still, for
that matter, you’ve given me the right of
way.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” replied the Chief, “there are no
strings. But just remember what I predicted.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span></p>

<p>“I dare say you were right. And, anyway, I
promise to play fair.”</p>

<p>Sam looked puzzledly from one to the other.
There was something here that he didn’t understand.</p>

<p>“Well, what do you say, Craig?” asked Mr.
York. “Going to come along and be company
for me for a day or two?”</p>

<p>“Thank you, yes, sir, if you’re quite sure——”</p>

<p>“Absolutely certain, old man! Now, where’s
your bag? And how about dressing? Not necessary,
is it, Mr. Langham? A couple of blankets
wrapped around him will do the trick, eh? All
right! I’ll bring the car up to the steps.”</p>

<p>Sam opened his eyes sleepily and blinked about
him. Near at hand a wide-open window, hung
with blue-and-white chintz that swayed gently in
the entering breeze, admitted a flood of sunlight.
Beyond the window was a white bureau. The
paper on the walls was grey with a tiny stripe
made up of blue rosebuds. Sam closed his eyes
again and wondered where he was. Then, stirring
under the bedclothes, he experienced a dull, jarring
ache in one knee, and suddenly recollection
came to him and he opened his eyes more widely
and stared around him.</p>

<p>Last night the room had been shadowed and
dim, with only a little lamp on the white reading-stand
beside the bed, and he had gone to sleep
almost as soon as Mr. York and Steve had helped
him between the cool, soft sheets. Now, in the
early morning light, the room looked much larger,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
and so bright and cheerful that it was a pleasure
to just lie there and look about.</p>

<p>There were three windows on two sides of the
spacious room, and through each of them, below
the shade, Sam could see blue sky between the
green branches of trees. On the reading-stand,
beside the small lamp with its pale-blue shade, lay
two magazines and a book and a glass tray that
held a pitcher of water, a drinking-glass, and
matches. The bed was enamelled white and over
the footboard lay a dainty cream-white puff with
blue poppies sprawling over it. Grey rag rugs
with blue borders were spread here and there on
the polished floor. Two wicker chairs, prettily
cushioned in the prevailing colours, flanked a red
brick fireplace in the middle of the further wall,
and a straight-backed white-enamelled chair was
half hidden under Sam’s clothes. A table between
two of the windows held his old-fashioned valise.</p>

<p>Sam sighed luxuriously and wondered what
time it was. Not, however, that it mattered much,
he supposed, for he had been told that he was
not to get up this morning until he had had his
breakfast and his knee had been rebandaged.
He snuggled his head more comfortably in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
generous pillow, inadvertently moving his knee
and grimacing as a result, and recalled last evening.
The trip in Mr. York’s roadster had occupied
but a very few minutes, for which Sam had
been very thankful, since, in spite of all the trouble
they had taken to arrange him comfortably beside
Mr. York, the jarring had set his knee thumping
painfully. Steve had ridden on the running-board
and had helped lift him in and out of the
car. Sam remembered the big room into which
they had entered from the twilight darkness, a
room of dark woodwork and red hangings and
cushions and many lamps which left the upper
part of the room in pleasant and mysterious
gloom. He hadn’t been allowed to see much down
there, though, for they had at once carried him up
a broad flight of stairs and into this blue-and-white
chamber, the like of which Sam had never
viewed. He remembered saying good night to
Steve and having his knee done up afresh in cool,
wet cloths, and—well, not much after that. He
must have gone to sleep almost the next instant!</p>

<p>Somewhere downstairs a clock struck in silvery
tones. He counted. Five—six—seven—eight!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
Eight o’clock! It couldn’t be possible! He must
have counted wrong. Why, he couldn’t remember
when he had lain in bed, much less slept, as late
as that! He began to wonder uncomfortably if
his injury could really be more serious than he had
supposed, for with Sam only real illness excused
staying in bed until such an hour. He lifted his
head experimentally and turned it from side to
side. It seemed to feel all right. And he couldn’t
detect any signs of fever. He had, of course,
heard of folks being internally injured, but he
didn’t know what the symptoms would be, and so
wasn’t certain if he had them. He really felt
remarkably well, except that his knee hurt if he
moved it or flexed the muscles, and, on the whole,
he concluded, not without a feeling of relief, that
he had mistaken the striking of the clock.</p>

<p>From somewhere not far off came the subdued
rushing of water. Someone was going to have a
bath. Therefore it couldn’t be very late. Also,
a moment later, he was pleasantly aware of a
faint aroma of coffee and something else that
might be broiling ham or bacon. He suddenly
knew that he was very, very hungry. A door
slammed nearby and a merry whistle floated down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
the hall. Then silence again. Sam closed his
eyes——</p>

<p>“——Breakfast coming up in a minute,” a
voice was saying, “and I thought maybe you’d
like to wash up a bit.”</p>

<p>Sam blinked dazedly. Beside the bed stood
Mr. York, smiling, fresh and cool in white flannels.
Sam viewed him in consternation.</p>

<p>“I—I believe I went to sleep again!” he stammered.</p>

<p>“I’m sure you did!” laughed his host.</p>

<p>“But—but what time is it?”</p>

<p>“Oh, about eight-thirty. It’s not late.”</p>

<p>“Eight-thirty! Why, I never slept that late in
my life!” exclaimed Sam in horrified tones. Mr.
York laughed delightedly.</p>

<p>“You have now, old chap. How’s it seem?”</p>

<p>“Fine, only—I’m wondering if—if I’m all right.
You don’t suppose I got hit on the head or—or
anything like that, do you, sir?”</p>

<p>“Great Scott, no! You just slept because you
were tired out and were in a new place and, if
I do say it, had a good bed. Now, how’s the knee
this morning?”</p>

<p>Mr. York himself attended to putting on new<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
bandages, in spite of Sam’s expostulations, and
brought him water in a bowl and soap and a face-cloth
and found his tooth-brush for him and generally
valeted him. Sam was all for doing things
for himself, even for being allowed to get up and
have his breakfast downstairs, but when, at Mr.
York’s request, he gently bent that right knee, he
concluded that he was not, after all, quite ready to
assert his independence. The thing was as stiff
and lame as could be.</p>

<p>“Thought so,” said the other. “You keep it
quiet to-day, Craig. To-night we’ll get at it with
liniment and to-morrow you’ll be up and around
again, I guess. After breakfast we’ll get you
down on the veranda. There you are, now. How’s
your appetite?”</p>

<p>Sam smiled. “I could eat a hedgehog, quills
and all,” he answered.</p>

<p>“Sorry we haven’t hedgehog this morning,”
laughed Mr. York. “I’m afraid it’s only the usual
ham and eggs and trimmings. But I’ll see that
you get enough of that.”</p>

<p>An hour afterwards, attired in a dressing-gown
of his host’s, Sam was lying at length in a long
wicker chair, propped up with many red cushions,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
on the broad veranda. Although considerably
lower than the neighbouring camp, “Greysides,”
as Mr. York called his place, was still pretty well
up in the world, and from the veranda one could
look over rolling hills and see, on fair days, the
distant blue of Lake Erie. The house was large,
or seemed so to Sam, and was of field stone and
grey weathered shingle, with numerous wide stone
chimneys and many squatty gable-ends. The
veranda that skirted three sides of the house was
as wide as a room, and from it, between stone pillars,
one saw on each side miles of rolling hills,
wooded or meadowed. A path turned and twisted
down a little slope from the broad steps to a break
in the stone wall that lined the road. There there
was a roughly-made trellis-arch of unbarked logs
on which a rose vine was showing a few late blossoms.
Behind the house the ground sloped upward
again, and the trees, well thinned out in
front, closed their ranks. Sam thought the place
wonderful and perfect, inside and out, and all
during that first forenoon was sorely tempted to
pinch himself to make sure that he was really
there.</p>

<p>Presently Mr. York joined his guest, pulling a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
chair near to Sam’s and chatting as he opened his
morning’s mail. Sam accepted a day-old newspaper
and idly glanced over the first page of it,
but somehow newspapers seemed of little interest
up here away from the world, and he soon let it
drop and returned to his contented and dreamy
contemplation of the distant hills. After a while
Mr. York tossed aside his letters and papers and
leaned back in his chair. Then they talked. Perhaps
it would be more accurate to say that Sam
talked, for Mr. York wanted to know many things
and Sam was soon telling all about himself and
about Amesville and the high school nine, with
Mr. York only contributing an occasional encouraging
word or a question. Normally Sam wasn’t
very much of a talker, and he didn’t remember
ever having said so much at once or told so many
intimate facts about himself before. Afterwards
he was surprised and a little embarrassed when
he recalled his loquacity.</p>

<p>But it wasn’t altogether one-sided, for Sam
learned somewhat of his host that morning, and
more subsequently. Mr. York—John Orville
York, in full—was an architect by profession and
lived in Cleveland. He was alone in the world<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
save for a sister whom he called Topsy—Sam
didn’t learn her real name. Topsy, Mr. York explained,
was just now away on a visit to friends in
the East and he was keeping bachelor’s hall. He
had been at “Greysides” since the middle of July,
with an occasional visit to the city, and his vacation
would be at an end in another ten days. Although
he did not say so, his visitor concluded
that he was wealthy; everything at “Greysides”
indicated it. He had graduated from Warner College,
where he had played three years on the baseball
team, and had afterwards studied his profession
in Chicago. He confessed to two passions.
One, he said, was baseball, and the other chess.
Did Craig play chess? No? Well, he ought to
learn it. It was the finest thing in the world.
After dinner they’d get the board out and have
a lesson, by Jove!</p>

<p>Almost before Sam realised that the morning
had gone luncheon was announced and they adjourned,
Sam leaning on Mr. York’s shoulder, to
a screen-enclosed porch that opened from the
dining-room, and sat down at a small table laid
for two.</p>

<p>“Hope you’ll find enough to eat,” said Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
York. “We don’t have very hearty lunches. I
usually play golf in the afternoon and find that
a heavy meal makes me slow.”</p>

<p>Sam truthfully replied that he didn’t doubt but
what there was more than enough, and events
proved him right. After cold meats and two
vegetables and a salad and hot rolls and a pastry
and two tall glasses of iced-tea he wondered what
Mr. York would consider a heavy meal!</p>

<p>“If you want to do anything—play golf, I mean,
sir—please don’t mind me,” said Sam when he
had hobbled back to the veranda. “I’ll be all right
alone. I can read or—or just sit here and look
at things.”</p>

<p>“Not many things to see, are there?” laughed
Mr. York.</p>

<p>“I mean just the view. It’s fine to be able to
see so far, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“It’s quite a view, and that’s a fact. But I
don’t care for golf to-day, Craig. Later on I’ll
run over to the village and get a letter off. Meanwhile
we’ll chin some more and then you’d better
lie down a while and have a nap. How’s the knee
now?”</p>

<p>“It isn’t nearly so sore, I think.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span></p>

<p>“That’s good, but we ought to moisten that
bandage again. I’ll tell William to bring some
water in a basin, and, as there’s no one to see,
we’ll perform the operation right here.”</p>

<p>They talked baseball while the sun travelled into
the west and the shadows began to lengthen under
the trees. Mr. York had many reminiscences of
college days, some exciting and some humorous,
and Sam was well entertained. From stories
Mr. York switched to the subject of catching.
“There’s one thing you ought to learn, Craig,”
he said, “and that’s to throw ‘from your ear.’
Ever try it?”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe I know what you mean, Mr.
York.”</p>

<p>“I mean throwing to base without taking a
step.”</p>

<p>“No, sir, I’ve never tried it. I don’t think I
could do it.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, you could. You can learn it. It’s not
as hard as it may seem. The beauty of it is that
it gives you another fraction of a second on the
runner, a matter probably of two or three feet
at the base. Try it some time and see what you
can do with it. It takes a snap of the arm instead<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
of the long, full swing, a quick snap that’s mostly
from the elbow; like this.” And Mr. York went
through the motions of catching a ball and throwing
to the base.</p>

<p>“It looks hard,” said Sam. “I don’t believe
I ever saw anyone throw that way.”</p>

<p>“Plenty of the league catchers do it. Have you
seen many league games?”</p>

<p>“No, sir, only two.”</p>

<p>“Really? It’s a good idea to go to them and
watch how they do things. You can pick up a
lot of good tricks that way. You’ve got the making
of a fine catcher, Craig, and I’d like to see you
go right ahead. You’ve got brains, for one thing,
and I’d rather have that in a catcher than mechanical
ability—if I had to choose between the two,
that is. Another thing that’s going to make you a
clever lad behind the bat is that you’re no weak
hitter yourself. There’s one criticism I’d like to
offer, though: you’re a little bit inclined to ‘slug,’
Craig. Don’t do it. I know that the slugging
hitter sometimes makes a corking good slam, but,
in the long run, he doesn’t deliver a good average.
He isn’t generally there in the pinches, Craig.
Any pitcher will tell you that he’d rather pitch to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
a ‘slugger’ than to a batter who shortens his bat
and his swing and ‘pushes’ the ball. A long swing
is likely to take your eyes off the pill just when
they should be glued to it, for one thing. And
then, again, you can’t place your hits so well.
Take the hit-and-run play, for instance. Suppose
the runner’s going down to second and shortstop’s
covering the bag, and you’ve got to poke one between
second and third. You can’t deliver the
goods with a long swing. You’ve got to shorten.
If you do swing long and connect with it, it’s dollars
to doughnuts the ball will go anywhere but
down that alley. And then, the first thing you
know, you’re doubled up. I dare say you think I’m
cheeky for criticising you like this, but I’d like
to see you make good. You’ve got a lot of the
ear-marks of a natural-born catcher, old man, and
good catchers—really good ones—are almost as
scarce as hens’ teeth.”</p>

<p>“I don’t mind it at all,” Sam assured him earnestly.
“It—it’s awfully good of you to tell me.
And I’d like to know how to do better.”</p>

<p>“That’s the stuff! No one knows it all—although
maybe you think I talk as if I did! I don’t,
not by a whole big lot. When I was catching for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
Warner I did a lot of the things I’m telling you
not to. I was the worst old heavy hitter on the
team. I was a regular joke on the batting list.
About once in every game I’d come through with
a regular whale of a slam, usually into right field.
Sometimes it would be good for three bases, or
sometimes two. More often, though, a fielder
would pull it down. Or, if he didn’t, that hit
would come along with the bases empty. When
there was a man on third and the pitcher tightened
up I was a frost. I pursued that misguided
course for two years. Then one day—we were
playing one of our big games—I happened to
overhear a remark made by the other team’s
pitcher. ‘York?’ he said. ‘I’ll pitch to him with
my eyes shut. The man’s a “swinger”!’ That
opened my eyes. I’d always thought the reason
I couldn’t hit when I wanted to hardest was because
the luck was against me or because the
pitcher put a little extra on the ball, knowing my
reputation as a long hitter. But that day it
dawned on me that it was no one’s fault but my
own. And the next morning I went out to the
net and I started to learn to bat all over again.
I never got into the three-hundred class, but I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
got where it wasn’t necessary to pull me out of the
game in the eighth or ninth inning when a hit
was needed to win.</p>

<p>“Mind you,” continued Mr. York, when he had
lighted his pipe again, “I’m not saying there
aren’t lots of ‘free hitters’ and ‘swingers’ with
big reputations; some of them have headed the
list in their time; but sooner or later the pitchers
find their weakness and then they go down quickly.
No, sir, it isn’t the ‘swinger’ who gets on oftenest,
and it isn’t the ‘swinger’ who makes the best
clean-up hitter. It’s the man who takes a short
swing, not a ‘chop’; that’s poor stuff; but a
healthy short swing, who comes across oftenest.
You try it, Craig. Don’t stand back and have to
reach for the ball, either. Crowd the plate a bit.
Get ‘over the ball,’ as they say.”</p>

<p>“I will,” replied Sam. “I guess you’re right
about a long swing. It <em>is</em> harder to judge the
ball. I’ve noticed that, especially when the ball
breaks close up. On a straight ball I can generally
connect, but anything foxy has me guessing. I
almost always get fooled on a drop or a floater.”</p>

<p>“It stands to reason. You’ve got to watch that
sort until the last minute and then you’ve got to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
swing quick, and from the elbows and not the
shoulders. As far as hitting for extra bases is
concerned, why, I can point out men who can almost
‘chop’ the ball for a two-bagger. I sort of
wish we had a ball and you were able to use that
leg of yours,” added Mr. York wistfully, “and a
bat.”</p>

<p>“That sounds like the old darky in Washington
who used to say, ‘If I had a little milk I’d have a
little mush if I had a little meal,’ doesn’t it?”
asked Sam.</p>

<p>Later Mr. York went off in his automobile and
Sam lay down on a couch in the big living-room,
and, to please his host, tried to take a nap. He
didn’t succeed, however. Dinner came at seven,
with the dining-room windows wide open and the
blue-black sky, a-twinkle with white stars, in sight
whenever Sam looked away from the mellow
radiance of the candles. And after that he had
his initiation into the mysteries of chess. Mr.
York said he did very well, but Sam feared that
he had been terribly stupid when the chessmen
were finally put away.</p>

<p>“That,” said Mr. York, seating himself again
in a big easy-chair and taking one knee into his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
hands, “almost did me out of my diploma at college.
One of the instructors and I used to play
chess five evenings a week until all hours. I just
scraped through my finals. Speaking of college,
Craig, I suppose you’ve got yours all picked out,
eh?”</p>

<p>“Me? No, sir. I—I guess I won’t go to college.”</p>

<p>“Won’t go! Why not?”</p>

<p>“Can’t afford it, sir,” replied Sam, with a twinkle.
“They say it costs money.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that!” said Mr. York carelessly. “You’d
like to, wouldn’t you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, I’d like to well enough, but——”</p>

<p>“Lots of chaps go through without a cent, or,
at least, with almost no money. There were half a
dozen chaps in my class at Warner who were a
heap—er—who had less to spend than you have.”</p>

<p>Sam looked puzzled. “But how did they do it,
sir? You mean scholarships?”</p>

<p>“Partly, in one or two cases. The trouble is
with scholarships, Craig, that you usually have to
work hard for them and you can’t ever be certain
you’ll pull one down. No, the chaps I was thinking
of were fellows who were rather prominent in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
sports—football, baseball, track. They found jobs
waiting them. A couple were managers of frat
houses, one was a sort of assistant in the Athletic
Director’s office and had the programme
privilege. There are quite a few jobs like that
to be had by wide-awake chaps with—er—athletic
ability.”</p>

<p>“Oh,” said Sam softly, “I see.”</p>

<small>MR. YORK MAKES A PROPOSITION</small></h2>
</div>


<p>“It works well both ways,” continued Mr. York.
“The college gets the services of, say, a good football
man, and the student gets an education. It’s
a fair exchange.”</p>

<p>“But isn’t it a good deal like—like paying a
fellow to play for the college, sir?”</p>

<p>“Oh, there’s nothing like that to it! Here’s the
way it’s done, Craig. Most graduates like to see
their college stand high in everything, athletic as
well as educational efficiency. Some of them have
money and they’re glad to spend a portion of it
for their college. When they run across a fellow
who—well, a fellow like you, for instance, who has
a talent for baseball, they say to themselves,
‘Here’s a chap who could help us win our games.
He can’t afford to go to college unless he can find
some way to meet his expenses. Let’s find a position
for him.’ So they use their influence and
the chap gets the managership of one of the fraternity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
houses, or becomes dining-hall steward, or
something of that sort. The work isn’t hard and
the salary is sufficient to pay his tuition and ordinary
expenses; and he gets his room and board
as a part of his remuneration. He has plenty of
time for study and plenty of time to perform his
part of the—er—bargain, which is to play on the
eleven or the nine or whatever the team may be.
It’s all honest and fair and—customary.”</p>

<p>Sam looked troubled. “I didn’t know that was
done,” he said after a moment. “Of course, I’d
heard of such things, but I always thought it was
just—just talk.”</p>

<p>“It’s done every day,” replied the other cheerfully.
“Lucky it is, too, for a lot of worthy fellows
who otherwise wouldn’t get the education
they need. Take your case, Craig. I don’t know
what line you expect to take up, but whatever it
is, you know as well as I do that you ought to go
through college. There’s nothing like a college
education to fit a chap for his profession
or business. I don’t mean only what he learns
from books; I mean what he learns from association
with other men of his own age, from instructors
and professors as well; from being part of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
a small and busy world in which he is confronted
by just such problems and difficulties—temptations,
too—as he will meet with later in the bigger
world. He has responsibilities and duties and
learns to meet them and perform them, and in
doing it he acquires self-dependence and self-control.
A college education is a sort of general
massage, Craig; it develops mind and body, brain
and muscles. Don’t you think that’s so?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, I guess it is, but——”</p>

<p>“Very well. Now you need college, old man.
Why not have it? You have something to exchange
for your course. You have a fine talent
for baseball. Take my own college, for instance,
Warner; and there isn’t a finer one East or West.
We need a chap like you to play on our ball team
in a couple of years. And in return for your services
we’ll give you an education. We won’t do it
by buying you, Craig. We will do it by finding
you a position that will meet your money requirements.
And there’ll be no strings to you. We
simply say, ‘Here’s a four-year course at Warner
for you, which you are to pay for by filling this
position to the best of your ability. All we ask
beside that is that you play baseball for us and do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
your honest best to make good.’ That’s all. See
what I mean?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“Of course, if you had told me that you had
selected your college I wouldn’t have said anything
about this. But you haven’t, and you tell
me you don’t believe you’ll go to college because
of the expense. So, being a loyal grad, as well as
a baseball enthusiast, I make this proposition to
you, Craig, knowing that it is a mutually beneficial
one; beneficial to you, as you can’t help seeing,
and beneficial to Warner College in the way
I’ve pointed out. And, lest you think the thing is
all loyalty and unselfishness on my part, I don’t
mind acknowledging that it would give me a lot
of genuine satisfaction and pleasure, as well as a
new interest, to be the means of bringing you and
the college together. I don’t ask you to decide
this matter now. Take all the time you want,
Craig. You’ve got a year at high school yet, and,
for that matter, if you preferred to wait another
year before entering college there’d be no objection.
In fact, it might be a good plan. You’d
still be only nineteen, which is young enough, and
you’d probably be of more good to the team. Of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
course, though, if you did that you’d need to keep
on with your baseball work. It might be a good
idea for you to play one summer on an amateur
or a semi-professional team just for the experience.
But you’d have to be careful not to accept
any money. That sort of thing gets around and
you might find yourself a professional; in which
case we couldn’t use you at Warner, you know.
You mull it over, old man, and then, later on in
the autumn, drop me a line. Perhaps I’ll be down
in your town before long and we can talk it over
again. I’m not trying to force your hand to-night.
Take all the time you want to decide,
Craig.”</p>

<p>“I guess I don’t need any more time, Mr.
York,” answered Sam ruefully. “I’m very much
obliged to you, and—and I appreciate your wanting
to help me like that, but—I’d rather not, sir.”</p>

<p>“You think it over. Don’t decide now.”</p>

<p>“I’d rather, please. I’m sorry. If I’d known,
I wouldn’t have—have you let you go to all this
bother with me. I’m—I’m awfully sorry, Mr.
York, honest!” And Sam observed the other regretfully,
apologetically.</p>

<p>Mr. York stared a moment. Then, “Look here,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
Craig,” he said drily, “you’ve got rather a mean
idea of me, haven’t you?”</p>

<p>“Why, no, sir!”</p>

<p>“Sounds so. You think I invited you down
here to put you under an obligation to me, eh?
So that when I made that proposition to you, you’d
feel more or less obliged to accept it. Well, now
let me tell you something, Craig. I didn’t. I
asked you down here because I liked you and because
I wanted to do anything I could to make you
comfortable. You may believe that or not, as
you please, but it’s so.”</p>

<p>“I do!” said Sam earnestly. “I’m sorry I
thought anything else, even for a minute. If I’d
stopped to think I wouldn’t have, I guess. I—I
beg your pardon.”</p>

<p>“You needn’t, Craig. Come to look at it from
your point of view, I don’t blame you for your
conclusion. I guess it does look a bit as if I had
been ‘swiping.’ I’m sorry. But please get it out
of your mind, if it’s still there, that my—er—hospitality
has anything to do with my offer regarding
Warner. It hasn’t. I’d have asked you
here if you didn’t know a baseball from a quinine
pill——” Mr. York paused, laughed, and corrected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
himself. “Perhaps I shouldn’t have,
though, for my liking for you began when I saw
you catch that game last June. I’m inclined, you
see, to be predisposed in favour of any chap who
can play baseball well, and ready to hug one who
acts like a regular catcher. But I’d have asked
you here if I’d known beforehand that there
wasn’t a chance of nabbing you for Warner, old
man. That settles that. Let’s forget it. Sorry
I put myself in the position I did. As for the
proposition, why, we’ll say no more about it.”</p>

<p>“I think I’d like to explain a little,” said Sam.
“I don’t want you to think I’m—ungrateful——”</p>

<p>“Piffle!”</p>

<p>“Or—or goody-goody. But the thing looks to
me”—Sam hesitated and tried to choose an
expression that would not wound his host—“it
looks to me too much like—like cheating.”</p>

<p>“Then I haven’t put it well, Craig. Now, look
here——”</p>

<p>“Putting it well,” replied Sam, with a slow
smile, “wouldn’t affect the fact, sir, would it? It
seems to me that it doesn’t much matter whether
you give me money outright to pay my expenses
at Warner or whether you pay that money to a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
fraternity and say, ‘Here, you give this to Sam
Craig and tell him it’s salary.’”</p>

<p>“But it <em>is</em> salary!”</p>

<p>“But you’d be paying it, sir.”</p>

<p>“Someone would have to, and I could afford
it. Why, hang it, the thing’s done every day, I
tell you!”</p>

<p>“Maybe, sir, but——” Sam paused a moment.
Then, “Mr. York, if I happened to be your son
and I told you someone had made me such an
offer, would you say, ‘Take it’?”</p>

<p>“No, because if you were my boy it wouldn’t
be necessary for you to accept—er——”</p>

<p>“Charity, you were going to say, weren’t you,
sir? But suppose you couldn’t afford to pay my
tuition at college, sir. Then what? Would you
want me to accept the—the proposition?”</p>

<p>“Why not? It’s a fair business arrangement,
isn’t it, Craig?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps it is, but if you were my father would
you want people to say that I was being paid to
play baseball for some college?”</p>

<p>Mr. York’s gaze turned to the open door and a
frown puckered his forehead. Several moments
passed. Sam, with that little smile that seldom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
got farther than his eyes, watched and waited.
Finally Mr. York turned his gaze back to the boy
and an unwilling smile overspread his face, a
smile that was more than half a scowl.</p>

<p>“I’ll be blessed if I would, Craig!” he said.</p>

<p>Another moment of silence went by. Then,
“Just the same, old man, you took a mean advantage
of me, then,” he objected ruefully. “You
see, I haven’t a boy. Wish I had. If I had I’d
be as cranky as an old hen about him. Well,
that’s settled, Craig, and you win. I’m
sorry——”</p>

<p>He paused, pulled himself out of his chair, and
frowned.</p>

<p>“Hanged if I’m sorry,” he laughed. “I’m glad
of it! Langham told me I’d fall down, and—and
I guess, on the whole, I’m glad I did. Now let’s
go to bed, eh?”</p>

<small>HOME AGAIN</small></h2>

<p>Sam’s knee was so much better the next morning
that he announced his intention of joining the
campers that afternoon. Mr. York pressed him to
stay until next day, but, seeing that Sam really
preferred to take his departure, studied the itinerary
that Mr. Langham had left with Sam and
helped him locate the expedition.</p>

<p>“Take the two-fifty-two from here,” advised
Mr. York, “and change at Wickston for Norrence.
Let’s see what train you can get. Wickston—Wickston—south-bound—Here
we are. Leave
Wickston at four-twelve and arrive Norrence at
five-thirty-six. That’s rather late, isn’t it? And
after you get there you’ll have to find the camp.”</p>

<p>“I guess it won’t take long,” said Sam. “This
thing says, ‘Norrence, Lindenville road, east of
village.’ That oughtn’t to be hard to find.”</p>

<p>“No, if they camp where they say they will you
can get them in half an hour, I dare say. Besides,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
it doesn’t get really dark until nearly seven. I’d
like to have you stay longer, but if you insist on
going, why, I’ll take you over for that two-fifty-two.
I made a mistake in giving that knee of
yours such a good rubbing last night, Craig.”</p>

<p>“It certainly cured it, sir. It doesn’t hurt a
mite to-day, unless I punch it.” And Sam pressed
the knee experimentally, to Mr. York’s amusement.</p>

<p>“You’re a regular boy, Craig,” he laughed. “I
remember when I was a kid and had a toothache
I’d put my finger in my mouth and bite down on it
as hard as I could to see how badly it would hurt!
Well, we’ve got four hours before lunch, and if
you want to try out that leg of yours we’ll stroll
around and see the place.”</p>

<p>The morning passed quickly. The subject of
college was not mentioned again until, at half-past
two, they were speeding along the road to
the station in the grey roadster. Then Mr. York
said:</p>

<p>“Craig, could you pass a college examination
next fall if you had to?”</p>

<p>“I’m not sure,” replied Sam. “I don’t just
know what the requirements are, Mr. York. I’ve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
never thought much about it, you see, because it’s
never seemed I had any chance to get to college.
I guess I’d have trouble with my Latin, though.”</p>

<p>“Well, look here, I wish you’d try this winter
and see if you can’t get yourself ready. If nothing
comes of it, it won’t do you a bit of harm.
But—well, I hope something will come of it, old
man. I’d like very much to be sure that you were
going through college. Perhaps you think I’m a
strange sort of a chap to meddle so much in your
affairs, but you’ve made quite a hit with me, Sam,
especially since last night; and when I like anyone
I want to see him get all that’s coming to him.
I don’t care a continental what college you go to
or whether you play ball or don’t. That’s out of
it. But I would like to see you get to college.”</p>

<p>“I’d like it myself, Mr. York. Only I wouldn’t
want to go unless I could do it fairly.”</p>

<p>“You’re right, old man. The end doesn’t always
justify the means. Well, I’m going to put
my thinking cap on and see if between us we can’t
find a way. I’ll write to the secretary at Warner
and see if there’s a scholarship you could try for.
I’ll write to the other colleges around here, too.
Look here, if you could get a real job next summer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
that would pay you, say, eighteen or twenty
dollars a week, would you take it?”</p>

<p>“I’d jump at it!” said Sam. “But I don’t believe
I know enough to make that much, Mr. York.
There isn’t much I can do, I guess.”</p>

<p>“Seems to me you can do a good many things.
You told me you’d canvassed for books, sold
newspapers, and worked in a mill. And now
you’re being councillor in a boys’ camp.”</p>

<p>“None of those jobs paid eighteen dollars a
week, though, sir.”</p>

<p>“No, but what I’m getting at is that if you can
do those things you can do other things. The
only problem is to find something that will bring
you real money. With, say, a couple of hundred
dollars I dare say you wouldn’t be afraid to start
college.”</p>

<p>“N-no, sir. Two hundred wouldn’t go very
far, though, would it? Even at a state university?”</p>

<p>“It would pay your tuition, maybe. Tell you
what I want you to do, Sam, when you get home.
You go and see John Holden. I’m going to write
to him about you. He’s a fine fellow. You can’t
help liking him. And he is going to be a good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
man to know before very long. He’s only just
making his start now, but he’s the sort you can’t
stop, and in five years he will be Somebody in
your town. You go and see him and tell him who
you are. Get to know him. John and I are pretty
good friends; have been ever since we were freshmen
in college; they used to call us the Pair of
Jacks. In that way you and I’ll be able to keep in
touch. I’m a fairly busy man when I get back to
work and I’m not much of a letter-writer, but if
you’ll let me hear from you now and then I’ll see
that your letters don’t go unanswered. And I’ll
keep my eyes open and see if I can’t find some job
that will put some money in your pocket when
next summer comes.”</p>

<p>“I’d like that,” responded Sam gratefully.
“I’d be willing to do ’most anything, I guess.
Only—only I wouldn’t want you to—to just <em>make
up</em> a job for me, Mr. York.”</p>

<p>“You’re certainly suspicious!” laughed the
other. “But I give you my word, Sam, that if I
find anything for you it will be real work and well
worth the pay. Here we are, with four minutes
to spare. By the way, how about funds? All
right that way, are you?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span></p>

<p>“I have enough, thanks.”</p>

<p>“Quite sure? Glad to lend you a few dollars.
You can return it when you reach camp, you
know.”</p>

<p>“I have plenty, sir, truly.”</p>

<p>The car swept up to the platform and they
jumped out, Sam with his battered valise. By
the time he had purchased his ticket to Norrence
the train was bustling in. Mr. York went to the
car-steps with him and shook hands there.</p>

<p>“Good-bye, Sam. Take care of yourself, and
let me hear from you, please. I certainly enjoyed
having you with me, old man, and next summer, if
we can fix it, you must come up again. Good-bye!
Try throwing from your ear and shorten your
swing!”</p>

<p>Sam’s own farewells were drowned by Mr.
York’s and abruptly cut short by the sudden starting
of the train, but he managed a more or less
coherent speech of thanks before he got beyond
hearing. The last he saw of Mr. York was that
gentleman standing beside his car evoking excruciating
blasts on the electric horn with one hand
and waving farewell with the other.</p>

<p>Before dark Sam had found the encampment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
outside Norrence and was eating a belated supper.
The following three days were pleasant ones.
They broke camp every morning after an early
breakfast, fixed their packs, and hiked until an
hour before noon. Then came a three-hour rest
by the road, with dinner, and at about two they
were off again. They did about eighteen miles a
day, ate ravenously, slept like logs, and reached
Indian Lake the evening of the fourth day after
leaving Mount Placid, a little footsore but only
healthily tired. Kitty-Bett had a hot supper
awaiting them and they more than did justice to
it.</p>

<p>Sam found a letter awaiting him from Tom
Pollock. As it was short and concise we may as
well quote it in full. “Dear Sam,” wrote Tom,
“when are you coming home? The reason I want
to know is that Lynton is to play us here on the
sixteenth. She beat us the first game and we beat
her last Saturday, 5 to 1, and we’re going to play
off the tie. We want you to catch for us. I
looked up that letter from Mr. Langham and it
said the camp ran to September 13th. If that’s
so you’ll be back here by Thursday, I guess. Let
me know if you will and if you’ll play Saturday.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
All well here and I’m very busy. Sid is kicking
his heels against the counter as I write this and
wants to be remembered. Yours as ever,</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Tom</span>.”<br /></p>

<p>Sam answered the epistle the next morning and
saw it off by Jerry the mailman. (The boys took
delight in referring to Jerry according to the duty
he was at the moment engaged in, as “Jerry the
scullion,” “Jerry the iceman,” “Jerry the woodman,”
and so on. On one occasion, Dick Barry
discovered the versatile Jerry painfully inditing
a letter and promptly dubbed him “Jerry the
scribe.”) Sam told Tom that he expected to be
back in Amesville the sixth and would be glad to
catch for the Blues the following Saturday, if
nothing prevented.</p>

<p>A few days later came Visitors’ Day, and the
camp took on a gala appearance. Strings of flags
blossomed along the fronts of the buildings, pine
and hemlock branches were festooned about the
dining-hall, floors were scrubbed until they shone,
and no one, even with a microscope, could have
discovered a bit of paper or any sort of litter
from the landing back to the pulpit tree. The
visitors were not many in number, for parents<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
and friends living at a distance found it impossible
to reach Indian Lake before noon, but some
twenty-odd appeared, and seemed to thoroughly
enjoy the programme supplied for their entertainment.
There was an aquatic carnival in the morning,
with swimming and diving competitions and
canoe races, and another thrilling tilting contest,
to say nothing of a swimming exhibition by
Junior Councillor Craig. And at one o’clock
there was a special dinner for the guests, followed
by one not quite so “special” for the boys.
There was no siesta that day, which alone made it
blessed in the eyes of the fellows! In the afternoon
there were athletic events and a final ball
game between the Indians, “Camp Champions,”
as the banner which they displayed proudly announced,
and the Mascots. True to precedent the
Indians won in six innings, thus finishing their
season in a final burst of glory. The score was
16 to 4! But then, George Porter, with his mother
and sister to watch him admiringly, pitched a remarkable
game.</p>

<p>Some of the visitors stayed overnight, and for
these tents were erected. Camp-fire was an especially
merry occasion that evening. Very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
agreeably, the moon came up, big and mellow, at
nine and, so to speak, joined the party. The
musicians were never better, and the songs were
sung with unusual enthusiasm if no more melodiously.
Bedtime was set back a full hour
on this last night and it was nearly midnight
when quiet finally settled over the moonlit
camp.</p>

<p>The next morning the exodus began and by
noon only a half-dozen or so fellows remained to
bolt a hurried dinner and then tumble into the
waiting coach and disappear, cheering, toward
the village.</p>

<p>The councillors all remained with Mr. Langham
until the next day. Shutters were to be closed
and everything made ready for the winter before
they left. Supper that evening was a pleasant
meal. All were fairly tired, and they sat late
about one end of the Chief’s table and comfortably
talked over the summer and their plans for
winter. There was a little impromptu speech by
Mr. Langham, in which he thanked the others for
their help. And Mr. Haskins, replying for the
councillors, was quite funny in his serious way,
and they finally pushed back their chairs in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
laughter and strolled over to the office feeling
very kindly toward each other.</p>

<p>Mr. Langham, Mr. Haskins, and Sam travelled
southward together the next morning, Mr. Gifford
and Steve Brown parting from them at Indian
Lake. Sam, with nearly sixty dollars in his
pocket, a deep coat of tan over most of his body,
and a fine appearance of rugged health, stepped
from the train at Amesville at a little after four
o’clock into the arms of Tom and Sidney.</p>

<p>“Tom, do you know Mr. John Hall?”</p>

<p>Sam, swinging his legs from the counter at
Cummings and Wright’s, had to wait a full
minute for an answer, for Tom Pollock finished
writing an order for football supplies before he
raised his head. It was a little before nine o’clock
on the morning following Sam’s return to Amesville,
and the store was empty of customers. Tom
signed “Cummings and Wright Hardware Co.,
T. Pollock,” blotted the sheet, and pulled an
envelope toward him.</p>

<p>“John Logan Hall?” asked Tom then, glancing
up. “The lawyer, Sam?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I think so. What’s he like?”</p>

<p>“Sort of tall and thin; clean-shaven; wears a
Panama hat about ten years old; lives at the
Amesville Club, and has his office in the new
building. Why?”</p>

<p>“Mr. York wants me to go and see him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
They’re great friends. He was visiting Mr. Hall
when he saw that game last spring, like I told you.
Is he nice?”</p>

<p>“John Hall? I guess so. I don’t know him
except to speak to. He’s been in here once or
twice for golf balls. They say he’s one of the
best players at the Country Club. He seems a
nice sort, Sam. I don’t believe he’d bite you,
anyway.”</p>

<p>“N-no,” answered Sam seriously, “but it seems
sort of cheeky, doesn’t it? To call on a man
you’ve never even seen, I mean.”</p>

<p>“You used to call on men you’d never seen
when you sold that ‘Popular History of Ohio,’ or
whatever it was, didn’t you?”</p>

<p>“That was different.”</p>

<p>“Yes; you were trying to do them out of their
hard-earned money. All you want from Mr. Hall
is a kind word.”</p>

<p>“That was a perfectly good book,” answered
Sam defensively. “When do you suppose I’d find
him at his office?”</p>

<p>Tom glanced at the little tin clock on his desk.
“After nine, I guess.” He put his clasped hands
behind his head, leaned back, and viewed his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
friend amusedly. “Sam, you’re an awful coward
about some things, aren’t you?” he asked. “You
wouldn’t hesitate to try and sell a book to a man,
but you hate to just call socially.”</p>

<p>“I used to be scared to death every time I rang
a doorbell when I was selling that book,” replied
Sam, with a shake of his head. “I wish Mr.
York had given me a letter of introduction to
him.”</p>

<p>“Want me to go over with you and introduce
you?” laughed Tom. “If you feel so bashful
why not take a book with you and try to sell it
to him? I’ll lend you our telephone directory.
You can call it anything you like—‘Child’s
History of Amesville,’ ‘Things Every Lawyer
Should Know,’ ‘How to Tell the Trolley
Cars’——”</p>

<p>“Dry up,” said Sam. “What about this game
Saturday?”</p>

<p>“Why, nothing, except that we want like anything
to win it, Sam. Lynton does too. Fact is,
there’s quite a little rivalry between us this year.
They beat us pretty badly the first game and so
Sid got them to play us again. Then we licked
them. That was a week ago last Saturday. Then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
they decided they’d have to play a third game and
so they’re coming over to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“How did they happen to get away with the
first game?” asked Sam.</p>

<p>“Principal reason, better playing,” laughed
Tom.</p>

<p>“Did they get to you?”</p>

<p>“Not once.”</p>

<p>“Then how the dickens——”</p>

<p>“I didn’t play. We’d just got in a big invoice
of goods and I had to stay and help here at the
store. Mr. Cummings wanted me to go, but I
saw that Mr. Wright thought I ought to stick
around.”</p>

<p>“Who did pitch?” asked Sam.</p>

<p>“Various members of our brilliant team—Buster,
Tommy Hughes, and Joe Kenny. I believe
even Sid tried an inning. I dare say it was
a lot of fun for Lynton.”</p>

<p>“What was the score?”</p>

<p>Tom gazed at the ceiling. “Eighteen to three,”
he said softly.</p>

<p>Sam whistled. Then, “What about to-morrow?”
he asked anxiously. “Any more invoices
in sight?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span></p>

<p>Tom laughed. “Not a one. To-morrow, Sam,
we’ll everlastingly whale those chaps! Revenge
is the order of the day. By the way, they tried to
get us to agree to play the same line-up, but
we told them we couldn’t promise that.” Tom
grinned. “Then I wrote to you. How are you
hitting, Mr. Councillor?”</p>

<p>“Not much. Mr. York says I take too long a
swing. I guess I do, too.”</p>

<p>“Oh, never mind that if you hit the ball; results
are what count.”</p>

<p>“Mr. York says if I take a shorter swing I’ll
hit oftener.”</p>

<p>“Look here, Sam, I dare say this Mr. York of
yours is a fine chap and all that, but if you don’t
stop talking about him I’ll throw a fit! I haven’t
heard much else since yesterday but ‘Mr. York’!”</p>

<p>“He thinks you’re a great little pitcher, Tom,”
replied Sam, with a twinkle.</p>

<p>Tom smiled. “Why? Because I have big
ears?”</p>

<p>“Big ears?” Sam looked puzzled. “He didn’t
say anything about your ears.”</p>

<p>“That was a joke,” explained Tom patiently.
“There’s a saying that little pitchers have big<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
ears, you know, and you said he said—Oh, shucks!
Never mind, you’ll see it after a while.”</p>

<p>“You ought to label your jokes,” replied the
other gently. “How’s a fellow to know? How do
you feel about school, Tom?”</p>

<p>“Full of enthusiasm,” answered Tom. “I
dearly love my school. Next Monday it’s back to
the grind, eh? When are you going to call fall
practice?”</p>

<p>“As soon as possible, I guess. I’ve got to see
Mr. Talbot pretty soon.”</p>

<p>“Bat isn’t back yet, I think. He went out
West about three weeks ago, he and Mr. George;
Grand Canyon and all that. I suppose they’ll be
back in a day or two, though. Excuse me a
minute, Sam.”</p>

<p>A customer had entered and Tom arose to wait
on him. “I’ll see you later, Tom,” said Sam.
“Guess I’ll go and call on Mr. Hall.”</p>

<p>“All right. The directory’s in the booth back
there.”</p>

<p>Sam smiled gently and took his departure.
Main Street had quite a busy look now. A few
blocks further along, and on the opposite side,
what Tom had called the “new building” reared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
its fourteen stories high above the older structures.
It was there that Mr. Hall had his office,
and Sam, as he approached, searched the signs on
the lower windows. He didn’t see Mr. Hall’s
name, however, and before he could begin on the
next tier there was a collision and Sam, recovering
his balance and murmuring an apology, looked
up into the smiling face of a tall man of about
thirty years of age.</p>

<p>“No harm done,” said the man pleasantly.
“My fault, too, I guess.”</p>

<p>He stepped to the right and at the same instant
Sam embarrassedly stepped to the left. “Beg pardon,”
muttered Sam, and stepped further toward
the curb. So did the tall man. Sam felt the blood
creeping into his face. The man laughed.</p>

<p>“Well, we’ll never get anywhere this way, will
we?” he asked. “Now I tell you what we’ll do.
You stand quite still”—the man held up an admonishing
finger—“and I’ll carefully walk
around you. Don’t move!”</p>

<p>Sam, very red of face, obeyed silently and the
tall man circled him to the left. “All right!” he
said. “We’re off again!”</p>

<p>Sam looked after him. He walked with a quick,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
springy stride and wore a yellow and somewhat
battered Panama hat. The horrible suspicion
forced itself into Sam’s mind that the man was
John Hall! Tom had said that he was tall and
thin, and wore a ten-year-old Panama. Sam
couldn’t be certain about the age of that hat, but it
looked as if it might easily have seen ten summers,
and the man was tall, decidedly tall and
thin. There could be no doubt about it! Sam
very cautiously moved to a window and gazed unseeingly
into it, conscious of the amused glances
of several bystanders and of the heightened colour
in his face. What an idiot Mr. Hall must think
him, he mused. Well, there was no use trying
to find him in his office now, for he had disappeared
in the throng in the other direction. Sam
was heartily glad of it, for he had very little taste
left for that visit. Perhaps to-morrow—or the
next day——</p>

<p>He made his way back toward Cummings and
Wright’s. He had meant to make a purchase
there and had forgotten it. He was still thinking
of that awkward moment on the sidewalk when he
entered the store, and didn’t observe that Tom
was busy with a customer until he had himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
reached the counter. Even then he paid no heed
to the man beside him until Tom caught sight of
him, and grinned maliciously and observed:</p>

<p>“Hello, Sam! How are directories selling?”</p>

<p>Then, following the other’s glance, Sam discovered,
to his embarrassment, that the customer was
none other than the man in the Panama hat. The
latter was selecting half a dozen golf balls from
a box that Tom had presented, and had been very
intent on his task until Tom’s greeting called the
newcomer to his attention. Then he glanced up,
and a smile of recognition came to his face.</p>

<p>“Ah,” he said, “my late adversary!”</p>

<p>Tom looked puzzled and Sam most unhappy.
He tried to smile, but made a poor effort of it.
The man in the Panama returned to a study of
the golf balls. After a moment he completed his
selection and nodded to Tom.</p>

<p>“I’ll take these,” he said. Then, as Tom proceeded
to do them up, he turned toward Sam, who
was looking very intently at something in a show-case,
and viewed him appraisingly. Sam, well
aware of the scrutiny, felt his cheeks growing hot
again.</p>

<p>“I’ve been wondering ever since if it was an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
aëroplane,” said the man presently. Sam tried
to pretend that he didn’t know the remark was
addressed to him, but something compelled him
to meet the issue.</p>

<p>“What, sir?” he asked.</p>

<p>“I said I’d been wondering if it was an aëroplane,”
repeated the other. “I’m interested in
aëroplanes and wouldn’t want to miss seeing one.
It was that, wasn’t it?”</p>

<p>“I—I don’t quite understand,” stammered
Sam.</p>

<p>“I refer to your intent study of the heavens,”
replied the other, with deep gravity. “You
seemed to be so absorbed——”</p>

<p>“I was looking at the new building, sir. I—I’m
sorry I was so stupid!”</p>

<p>“So that was it? Well, I’m glad it wasn’t an
aëroplane.”</p>

<p>Tom, handing the package across and accepting
the bill proffered in payment, was plainly nonplussed.
It sounded to him as though the two
had gone quite crazy! He looked at Sam and then
at the man in the Panama, and, finally, as he returned
the change, he blurted:</p>

<p>“You two have met, then!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, yes, indeed—violently,” replied the man.
“Still, if you can introduce us properly——”</p>

<p>“Why, I thought——” began Tom. Then he
laughed. “Mr. Hall,” he said, “this is my friend
Sam Craig. Sam is selling directories, and I think
he was looking for you.”</p>

<p>“He found me,” replied the other quizzically
as he shook hands. “I’ve been trying to place
you, Mr. Craig, ever since we bumped. I remember
now that I saw you catch a game against
Petersburg last spring. You’re still playing ball,
I suppose?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir; that is, I—sometimes.”</p>

<p>“I really feel honoured in possessing the acquaintance
of two such talented players. I want
to see you chaps in action again sometime.”</p>

<p>“Better come to the game to-morrow, Mr.
Hall,” said Tom. “We’re going to play Lynton
at the school field at three.”</p>

<p>“To-morrow? Why, I’m afraid—The fact is,
I’m playing golf to-morrow afternoon. Sorry.
Wish I might see the game. Now, what about
these directories, Mr. Craig? I don’t believe I
want to invest, but if you care to tell me what it is
you’re handling——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span></p>

<p>“That’s only Tom’s joke, sir,” said Sam apologetically.
“I’m not selling anything.”</p>

<p>“Oh, then you weren’t looking for me?”</p>

<p>“No, sir—yes, sir, I was, only——”</p>

<p>“The plot thickens! Only what?”</p>

<p>“I mean I was going to your office, but after I
ran into you I thought there wouldn’t be any use
going, and so I came in here. I didn’t know you
were here, sir.”</p>

<p>Tom was enjoying Sam’s embarrassment
hugely. “Better confess everything, Sam,” he
said soberly, “if you want Mr. Hall to help
you.”</p>

<p>“Eh?” said Mr. Hall. Sam frowned.</p>

<p>“Cut it out,” he muttered.</p>

<p>“Look here, Mr. Craig, your story interests me
strangely,” declared the man. “You were looking
for me, only you weren’t. Sounds a great
deal as though you thought I was a dentist. By
the way, how did you know who I was when we
collided?”</p>

<p>“Tom told me that—I mean, he described you.”</p>

<p>“I’d like to have heard the description,”
chuckled Mr. Hall. “What was it, Pollock?”</p>

<p>It was Tom’s turn to be embarrassed. “I don’t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
just remember, Mr. Hall. This idiot was told to
call on you by a friend of yours, and he’s too
bashful to say so.”</p>

<p>“A friend of mine? Really?” Mr. Hall turned
to Sam interestedly. “Who was it, Mr.
Craig?”</p>

<p>“Mr. York said——”</p>

<p>“John York?” demanded the other eagerly.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. He said when I got home I was to
call and tell you he sent me. He said he would
write to you about it.”</p>

<p>“Just the sort of thing he would do!” laughed
Mr. Hall. “Sent you along without a letter of
introduction, eh? Well, I’m very glad to know
you, Mr. Craig. Any friend of John’s is my
friend.” He shook hands again heartily. “Where
did you meet him? Hold on, though, I must get
back to the office. Can’t you come along and tell
me about it? Or are you busy just now?”</p>

<p>“No, sir, I haven’t anything to do.”</p>

<p>“Then come along. We can talk better at the
office. Much obliged, Pollock. And, come to think
of it, I don’t know but what I’ll call off that golf
to-morrow and see you chaps play instead. I suppose
you’re going to pitch?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, sir, and Sam’s to catch. Maybe you’d be
willing to umpire for us?”</p>

<p>“Thank you for your sweet thought, Pollock,
but I’m too useful a member of this community
to risk my life. I’ll yell for you, but I’d rather
not take chances.”</p>

<small>MR. HALL TALKS BASEBALL</small></h2>
</div>


<p>On the way to the office Sam narrated the story
of his meeting with Mr. York, and his companion
chuckled at intervals. Sam had not concluded his
narrative when they passed through the door of
the Adams Building and entered the elevator.
Up they shot to the tenth floor and there Mr. Hall
led the way to an office on the side of the building.
The door held the inscription, “John T. Hall,
Attorney and Councillor-at-Law.” The office was
small, but light and cheerful, and was plainly
furnished. Mr. Hall hung his Panama on a hook
behind the door and pulled a chair forward for
his visitor, seating himself at his desk between
the two broad windows.</p>

<p>“Now we can be comfortable,” he said. “So
John said he’d write me a letter, eh?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. Didn’t he—hasn’t he——”</p>

<p>“No, nor ever will,” laughed the other. “I’ve
known him for almost twenty years and I’ve never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
had but three letters from him! He hates them
like poison; writing them, I mean. But it doesn’t
matter a bit, Craig. I’m just as glad to know you
as if he’d written twenty pages about you. Besides,
you can tell me more than he can, anyway.
You live here in Amesville, of course?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, on Curtis Street.”</p>

<p>“Then we’ll soon get acquainted. Your name
sounds familiar to me, by the way. Have I met
your father, perhaps?”</p>

<p>“No, sir, he’s dead. There’s just my mother
and sister and me, sir. You might have met my
sister, though. She does typewriting here. She
has a room on the third floor.”</p>

<p>“Of course! Miss Craig and I have had a lot
of business together. So she’s your sister, is
she? Well, she’s a fine, smart girl, Craig, and a
good stenographer, too, by George! I suppose
you and John talked baseball a good deal,
eh?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, quite a lot.”</p>

<p>“And he gave you a heap of advice, too, I’ll
wager!”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, some.”</p>

<p>“Of course! He’s as full of advice as a pudding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
is of plums. He’s the sort who wants everyone
to do things his way,” chuckled Mr. Hall.
“We used to have some fine old spats when we
were in college together. John not only wanted
to catch, but pitch, too. If he could have had his
way he’d have played every position on the team,
I guess!”</p>

<p>“He told me two or three things I didn’t know
about catching, Mr. Hall.”</p>

<p>“Oh, he can tell you things, all right! He’s
full of perfectly wonderful information. He’s the
sort who, if he was presented to the King of England,
would start right off telling that gentleman
how to improve his batting average!”</p>

<p>Sam smiled. “What he told me sounded pretty
good, though,” he said defensively.</p>

<p>“It <em>was</em> good; no doubt about that, Craig.
Theoretically, John York was the best catcher
Warner ever had. Actually, he was the most uncertain.
You see, he was full of theories. He
doped everything out ahead and when things
didn’t go the way he’d arranged them there’d be
trouble. He’d study a new batter when he came
up and decide that the man would hit a high ball
over the outside corner into left field. Then he’d<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
signal for a low one and the batter would crack it
into the middle of next week, and John would be
so surprised and grieved about it! After the
inning he’d sit on the bench and prove conclusively
to you that the man had no business hitting a low
one, that he was built for high ones! The trouble
with John was that he wouldn’t practise what he
preached. He knew how a thing ought to be
played, but he had a hunch that he’d get better
results if he played it differently. I used to tell
him he thought too much with his head. But in
spite of all that we loved him. He was one of
the most popular fellows in college. And you’re
not to think that he always went wrong with his
game, for he didn’t. Lots of times his theories
worked out like miracles.”</p>

<p>“I remember”—Mr. Hall picked up a paper-knife
and, leaning back in his swivel chair, played
with it and smiled reminiscently—“I remember a
game we played with Michigan. John was captain
that year. (We made him captain because
he’d have been it anyway and we thought there’d
be no use having two.) We were two runs behind
Michigan in the seventh and hadn’t got a run
across for three or four innings. Michigan’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
pitcher had us eating out of his hand, and if anyone
did start a rally their infield cut it off. So,
in the seventh John said, ‘Look here, fellows,
we’re playing too close to the ground. What
we’ve got to do is cut loose and run wild for a
couple of innings. Now I want every one of you
to hit at anything you see, as long as you don’t
have to walk out of the box for it, and when you
get on first I want you to go down to second on
the first ball. And when you get to second, try
for third. Those chaps aren’t used to fireworks.
Let’s show them some.’</p>

<p>“Well, we wanted that game; we were always
crazy to beat Michigan; and it didn’t look as if we
were going to get it. Michigan was playing one
of those scientific games—every man fielding perfectly;
pitcher and catcher working together like
two cog-wheels; everything figured according to
the laws and commandments of baseball. There
didn’t seem to be anything to lose by following
John’s scheme and so we tried it. The first batter
up for our side acted as if he’d never heard
of waiting. He whaled away at everything in
sight and got a scratch hit somehow and went to
first. And then he started down the path on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
first delivery. He was thrown out, though. But
you could see that Michigan was beginning to
wonder. Our next man slammed around and
knocked fouls and finally got a clean hit, the first
for half an hour. He followed instructions and
stole second easily, in spite of a pitch-out, catcher
throwing low to the base. Then we had them going.
The next man drew his base and the man on
second lighted out for third. He ought never to
have got it, but he did. Someone fumbled. After
that we ran wild on the bases. Even with two out
we didn’t show any sort of baseball sense. We
did everything we shouldn’t have done, and Michigan
found herself as far up in the air as a balloon.
We got five runs across in that inning on two hits
and a pass!”</p>

<p>“And won the game?” asked Sam.</p>

<p>“N-no, we didn’t, as a matter of fact. We
ought to have, but those chaps got to me in the
ninth and knocked me out of the box. I suppose
romping around the bases and sliding on my ear
sort of tuckered me. Anyway, they hammered me
to the bench and then got two hits off Whipple
and scored enough to win. Still, as John showed
us, we <em>ought</em> to have won!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span></p>

<p>“I’d like to have seen it,” said Sam.</p>

<p>“It was some game,” assented the other. “I
guess I’ll have to go out to-morrow and see you
fellows play. I will if you’ll let me sit on the
bench and mix in.”</p>

<p>“I wish you would,” said Sam. “I dare say
you could tell us some things that might help,
Mr. Hall.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m no John York!” laughed the lawyer.
“I haven’t many theories, Craig. I’ve always
played the game by rule of thumb, so to say. This
close-harmony, inside stuff has always been a bit
beyond me.”</p>

<p>“But there’s a good deal in it, isn’t there?”
asked Sam. “Inside baseball, I mean.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, I guess so. Only I never could figure
it. What time do you play to-morrow?”</p>

<p>“Three o’clock, sir.”</p>

<p>“I’ll be there.” He opened a desk drawer and
dropped the package he had brought from the
store into it. “Those can wait,” he said. “I like
golf, but I guess I’d rather see a good ball game,
after all.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know how good to-morrow’s game
will be, Mr. Hall,” said Sam doubtfully. “Most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
of the fellows are pretty young and we make lots
of mistakes.”</p>

<p>“Well, what’s the odds, eh? It’s fun, isn’t it?
Hold on, don’t run away, Craig.”</p>

<p>“I guess I’ll be going, sir, thanks. I’ve got
some things to do at home. I’ve been away so
long things have sort of got behind there.”</p>

<p>“Well, you know where to find me. And, look
here, do you ever play golf?”</p>

<p>“No, sir, I’ve never tried it.”</p>

<p>“You’re not too old,” replied the other, with
a smile. “Some day you and I’ll go out to the
Country Club and have a whack at it. You’ll
like it, and I’ve got plenty of clubs. Want to?”</p>

<p>“Yes, thanks, only it—it wouldn’t be much fun
for you.”</p>

<p>“How do you know that? You don’t know me
well enough yet to say what my sort of fun is,
Craig.” He smiled quizzically. “As a matter of
fact, I’d like it. I’ll see you to-morrow. By the
way, I live at the Amesville Club. Come around
some evening and chin. There’s something that
passed between you and John York that you
haven’t told me about yet. Good-bye.”</p>

<p>Sam shook hands again and took his leave, descending<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
by the stairs to the sixth floor and making
his way to a door whose ground-glass bore the
legend, “Miss Craig, Stenographer,” and from
behind which came the busy clatter of a typewriter.
Nell Craig was hard at work when Sam
entered, and she only nodded and smiled until she
had finished the sheet she was on and had pulled
it from the carriage. Then she laid it aside and
turned to view Sam questioningly. She was a
rather pretty girl of eighteen, with light hair and
more delicate features than her brother’s. She
looked alert and capable, and quite businesslike
in the plain black gown she wore.</p>

<p>“I saw him,” said Sam. “He seems rather
nice.”</p>

<p>“Of course he does. I told you you’d like him,”
replied Nell. “He’s the nicest customer I have.”</p>

<p>“He said you were a smart girl and a good
stenographer,” answered Sam. “Looks like a
case of what-do-you-call-it—mutual admiration.”</p>

<p>Nell laughed. “It’s more fun working for men
you like, Sam. Some of them are rather gruff
and horrid. What did he say to you?”</p>

<p>“Nothing much. Said he was glad to know
me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span></p>

<p>“But didn’t you talk at all?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I suppose so. We talked baseball a good
deal, I guess.”</p>

<p>Nell’s nose wrinkled. “Baseball! Is that all
you could find to talk of? Did you tell him what
Mr. York said about you going to college?”</p>

<p>Sam shook his head. “No. I guess that
wouldn’t interest him much.”</p>

<p>“But you ought to. Maybe he might know of
someone who would help you or—or something,
Sam.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe so. Anyway, I don’t want to—to
know folks just so’s they can help me, do I?
He’s coming to see us play Lynton to-morrow.
And he wants me to go to the Country Club with
him some day and learn golf.”</p>

<p>“Well, I think you got on splendidly,” said
Nell delightedly. “Everyone says he’s awfully
smart, Sam, and I guess he’s beginning to
get quite a practice. I know I do three times
as much work for him as I did at first. I’m
sure he will be a splendid man for you to
know.”</p>

<p>“I don’t want to know him just because he
might do something for me,” objected her brother.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
“Folks can be friends for—for other reasons,
can’t they?”</p>

<p>“Of course, but there’s no harm in having
friends that are influential, Sam,” replied Nell
wisely. “Folks who get on, I notice, cultivate
friends who can help them. That’s plain common
sense, Sam.”</p>

<p>“Plain common selfishness, you mean,” he answered.
“All folks can’t do that sort of thing,
because look at the people who have been nice to
me lately. Much good I could do them!”</p>

<p>“I’m not so sure,” replied Nell thoughtfully,
smiling a little. “There are lots of ways to help
a person, Sam. Now, that Mr. York, I dare say
you helped him.”</p>

<p>“Helped Mr. York!” ejaculated Sam. “I’d
like to know how!”</p>

<p>“I don’t know that. Maybe, though, you took
his mind off some worry, or cheered him up when
he was feeling unhappy.”</p>

<p>“I guess he never needed cheering up,” said
Sam. “But I see what you mean, sis. It doesn’t
sound so bad that way. Well, I must get along.
I asked Tom up to supper to-night. He and I are
going to practise a little for to-morrow. If you’re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
going home early, I’ll wait around awhile for
you.”</p>

<p>“I’m not, Sam, not very early to-day, thanks.
I’ll try to get home by one, though. Tell mother
not to wait for me. I’ve promised all this by
twelve, and then I’ve got some letters to take for
Mr. Hall.”</p>

<p>“Oh,” said Sam musingly, watching Nell deftly
introduce a “carbon sandwich” into the carriage
of the typewriter. “Mr. Hall.”</p>

<p>“Exactly,” replied Nell, spacing briskly.</p>

<p>“Hm. I wonder, now——”</p>

<p>“What?” she asked as he stopped.</p>

<p>“I wonder whether Mr. Hall likes me. He sort
of seemed to.”</p>

<p>“Why shouldn’t he?” she asked cheerfully.</p>

<p>“That’s so. Maybe I could help him, you
know.”</p>

<p>“Of course! That is—well, in what way,
Sam?”</p>

<p>“There are lots of ways, you said. I might”—Sam
edged toward the door—“I might say a good
word for him to my sister!”</p>

<p>Nell tossed her head. “You can’t tease me
about Mr. Hall, Sam,” she said untroubledly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
“He and I are good friends, but we’re both of us—businessmen!”</p>

<p>“Then what are you blushing for?” demanded
Sam meanly.</p>

<p>“I’m not blushing, silly! Do run away and let
me get to work!”</p>

<p>“Oh, all right.” Sam went out, but, just before
the door closed finally behind him, he added
softly, “Say, sis!”</p>

<p>“Go away, please!”</p>

<p>“He’s not bad-looking, is he?”</p>

<p>The hurried clatter of the machine followed him
along the hall until, with a little smile around his
eyes, he turned the corner and pressed the elevator
signal.</p>

<p>Sam was surprised the next afternoon when he
reached the high school athletic field to find that
the game with Lynton had drawn together quite
an audience. Perhaps the fact that the summer
weather still held, with no hint as yet of autumn,
accounted for the baseball enthusiasm. Usually
by the middle of September the fellows were far
too engrossed with football to heed the rival game.
To-day the school had turned out in force, and
there was a fair sprinkling of girls in the stand.
Sam met many acquaintances he had not seen
since his return and his progress through the gate
and around to the dressing-room was slow.
Frank Warner, last year’s captain of the high
school team, for whom Sam had never entertained
a very great liking, was quite affable. Frank, as
he confided with studied carelessness, was off to
college the middle of next week. Sam said he
hoped he’d like it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, I dare say I’ll like it well enough,” replied
the other. “It’s not a bad place, I guess.
I’m going to Warner, you know. They turn out
some pretty decent teams there. I’m going to
have a try for freshman football. I suppose college
isn’t included in your scheme, Sam.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t know,” replied the other, trying
not to show his resentment of Frank’s patronising
tone. “I rather expect to go to Warner myself
next fall. May see you there, Frank. Good
luck.”</p>

<p>He turned away with a careless nod and sought
the dressing-room. And as he went the determination
to enter Warner College next year, by
hook or crook, took possession of him. Until that
moment he had not viewed the idea seriously, in
spite of Mr. York’s enthusiasm and his own desire,
but now he told himself that somehow he
would carry it out, if only, he added grimly, to
show Frank Warner that he didn’t own the college,
even if it did have the same name! And
then he was in the dressing-room and a shout of
welcome arose, and he had to forget his great resolve
and return the greetings of the dozen or so
fellows present.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span></p>

<p>There was Tommy Hughes and “Buster”
Healey and young Peddie and Sid Morris and
Tom and Pete Farrar and Bert Meyers and six or
seven more, many of them just back from summer
vacations and pleading with Tom to be allowed to
join the Blues for the occasion. Tom good-naturedly
accepted them all as substitutes and
promised to use them as he could, and consequently,
when the team gave up the field to Lynton,
some twenty minutes later, the home team’s
bench was much too small to accommodate all the
players and substitutes. Mr. Talbot, the high
school coach, appeared accompanied by Mr.
George, the latter a former league pitcher, who
had helped with the team the preceding spring.
It was Mr. Talbot who drew Tom’s attention to a
big, wide-shouldered youth, who was lazily pitching
the ball to a substitute catcher at the far side
of the diamond.</p>

<p>“You don’t mean they’re going to pitch that
fellow, do you?” asked the coach.</p>

<p>Tom looked and shook his head. “I never saw
him before,” he said. “Wonder where they got
him. They wanted us to agree to play to-day
with the same line-up we had before, but I refused<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
because I wanted Sam to catch for us. I
guess they thought they’d strengthen themselves
some, too. That fellow must be twenty-three or
four.”</p>

<p>“All of that, I guess. And from the easy way
in which he handles that ball I’d say he’d done
it before,” added Mr. Talbot drily. “Probably a
college man they’ve picked up.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see,” said Tommy Hughes, who had
joined them, “why two can’t play at that
game, sir. You might play for us, Mr. Talbot.”</p>

<p>“I guess not. Teams don’t usually play their
coaches, Hughes.”</p>

<p>“But you’re not our coach, sir. This isn’t the
high school team, it’s the Blues.”</p>

<p>Mr. Talbot laughed. “Really? But I see quite
a few familiar faces! You might get Mr. George
to play, though.”</p>

<p>“He’s going to umpire,” said Tom. “I just
asked him. There’s Mr. Hall coming in, though.
He used to pitch. We might ask him.”</p>

<p>“John Hall? What’s he doing here?” Mr. Talbot
asked.</p>

<p>“He’s a friend of Sam’s and we asked him to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
come to the game. You know him, don’t you, Mr.
Talbot?”</p>

<p>“I’ve met him,” replied the coach briefly. Then
he smiled. “The fact is, Tom, we’re opposing
counsel in a case that’s been running along since
last winter, and we’ve had to hammer each other
pretty hard in court. But I don’t know that need
keep us from fraternising at a ball game.
You’d better go over and rescue him. He’s looking
for a place to sit down, and the bench is
full.”</p>

<p>But Sam had seen the newcomer and yielded his
seat to him when Tom arrived. Mr. Hall, protesting,
sat down and then listened to Tom’s message.
“I pitch?” he said finally. “Why, Pollock,
I haven’t had a baseball in my hand for years!
I’d like to oblige you, but I’d make a mess of it.
You’ll do it twice as well as I could.”</p>

<p>“If Tom gets into trouble,” suggested Sam,
“you might try it, Mr. Hall. Would you?”</p>

<p>“Why, yes, I suppose so, if I’m really needed.
But give me a chance to limber up, fellows. My
arm’s pretty stiff, I guess. Swinging a golf club
isn’t quite the same as pitching a baseball. How
does it come, though, that you’re letting them use<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
that man? Looks to me like a professional, Pollock.”</p>

<p>“Well, sir, we haven’t any sort of an agreement
as to who’s to play. It doesn’t seem quite
fair to call on chaps as old as he is, but as they’ve
done it we thought we could.”</p>

<p>“I’d say you had every right to, but if I were
you I’d see if I couldn’t pull through with my regular
players. Then if you do win you’ll have something
to be proud of. How do you, Mr. Talbot?
Glad to see you again.” Mr. Hall arose and the
two lawyers shook hands in a friendly way.
“For once, I take it, we’re both on the same
side!”</p>

<p>“That’s so,” Mr. Talbot replied, with a smile.
“We’ll bury our hatchets for this afternoon.
Are you going to help these chaps out, Mr.
Hall?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t think they’ll need my help. I was
just saying to them that they ought to see what
they could do without—er—legal assistance.
Take my advice, Pollock, and keep away from
lawyers as long as you can. That’s right, isn’t it,
Mr. Talbot?”</p>

<p>“Good advice, but unprofitable to us,” was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
reply. “The audience is getting impatient, Tom.
Are you ready?”</p>

<p>From the stand came cries of “Play ball!”
and Mr. George, struggling to fit to a rather large
head a mask that was several sizes too small for
him, called, “Batter up!” The Amesville Blues
trotted to their places and Lynton presented her
first man.</p>

<p>Mr. Talbot and Mr. Hall, left with the substitutes,
settled down to watch the game. Mr. Hall
sighed comfortably. “This is what I like,” he
said.</p>

<p>Mr. Talbot looked a question.</p>

<p>“Sitting on a bench,” explained the other,
“with nothing to do but watch a couple of teams
play ball. It beats working all hollow!”</p>

<p>Mr. Talbot laughed. “That’s so, but for my
part I’d rather be out there playing, Hall.”</p>

<p>“Y-yes, so would I, except that I’m too rusty
now to try it. Golf’s about the only game left to
us older chaps.”</p>

<p>“You don’t look so superannuated. Dare say
you could puzzle them a bit yet if you tried. One
down,” he added as the first Lynton batsman
trailed his bat away from the plate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span></p>

<p>“Wonder if I could,” mused Mr. Hall. “I’d
rather like to try, I guess. You went to college in
the East, didn’t you, Talbot?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Pennsylvania. And you?”</p>

<p>“Warner. We never met you chaps.”</p>

<p>“No, I think not. Good work, Healey! That
boy can handle them mighty well for a youngster.
That’s two down. Tom Pollock hasn’t got his
stride yet, or else he isn’t working. Those two
chaps make a great team.”</p>

<p>“Pollock and Craig? What sort of a fellow is
this Craig boy?”</p>

<p>“Just what you see. Quiet, straightforward,
honest as they make them. Not exactly brilliant—Look
at that for a drop!—not brilliant exactly,
but sensible and brainy. Pollock said Sam was a
friend of yours, I thought.”</p>

<p>“He is. I met him yesterday.”</p>

<p>Mr. Talbot smiled. “Not of long standing,
then.”</p>

<p>“No, the fact is we have a mutual friend, Craig
and I. We’re just getting acquainted. I like
him, though, so far.”</p>

<p>“You’ll keep on then, for Sam doesn’t change
much. That’s one thing that makes him a mighty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
good catcher. He’s as steady as a rock. Plays
the same game to-day he did yesterday, except
that he probably gets a little better all the time.
He isn’t the sort who have flashes of fine form one
day and then slump the next. That’s the stuff,
Tom! Who’s scoring? You, Steve? When does
that pitcher of theirs come up? Fifth on the list?
I thought so. I guess he’s going to make trouble
for us. What’s his name?”</p>

<p>“Smith,” replied Steve Arbuckle.</p>

<p>“Smith! I’ll wager he has another name at
home,” said Mr. Talbot. “If he gets too gay I’ll
go in there myself, unless you will, Hall.”</p>

<p>“I would if I thought I could do any good.
We’ll see how things turn out. There goes the
last man. That’s three, isn’t it? Now then,
Amesville, show what you can do!”</p>

<p>The Blues didn’t do much of anything. The
mysterious Smith was too much for the first three
batsmen and they all went out on strikes. The
last one, however, nearly got his base by reason
of a third strike which got past the catcher. The
ball headed him off at the base, though, and the
first inning ended with only six men having seen
the plate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span></p>

<p>“That’s the only thing that may give our boys
a look-in,” said Mr. Talbot.</p>

<p>“You mean passed balls?” asked Mr. Hall.
“That’s so; that catcher of theirs is finding it
pretty hard to hold the pitcher.”</p>

<p>As Steve Arbuckle, last year’s manager of the
nine, phrased it, setting a neat “k” in the appropriate
space, “Another redskin bit the dust!”
Which, interpreted, meant that the first Lynton
batter had fallen before Tom’s curves. That
brought Smith, the pitcher, up, and the audience
on the bench watched curiously. He was a good-looking
chap, but, as Mr. Hall insisted, there was
something in his appearance that suggested the
professional, or, perhaps, semi-professional ball
player. It may have been the easy, untroubled,
almost listless manner in which he walked to the
plate, rubbed his hands on the seams of his trousers,
swung his bat once, and then faced Tom Pollock.
“For all the world,” muttered Mr. Hall,
“as if he was sure of his pay-envelope whether he
hits or doesn’t.”</p>

<p>Tom worked a low one over for a strike and
Smith merely glanced at the corner of the plate,
over which it had passed. A curve went for a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
ball. A second crossed knee-high but was too
close for a strike. Smith stood motionless, save
for the incessant working of his jaws as he chewed
gum. Sam, kneeling, laid four fingers vertically
against his mitten, the signal for a slow ball. He
argued that with two balls on the pitcher, Smith
would expect a fast one over the plate. Tom
stepped forward and pitched. There was a solid,
resounding thud and the ball shot across the diamond,
passed like a bullet between shortstop and
third baseman and, far out in the field, struck the
sod and bounded into centre fielder’s glove. The
throw to second was too late to get the runner,
however, for the redoubtable Mr. Smith slid beautifully
and hooked a foot against the bag before
the ball got to him. The small party of Lyntonites
shouted delightedly and Mr. Hall and Mr.
Talbot exchanged glances.</p>

<p>“Looks as if he’d hit a ball before,” said the
latter drily.</p>

<p>“Wouldn’t wonder if he’d run bases before,
too,” observed Mr. Talbot. “Lucky thing for us
they didn’t have men on bases.”</p>

<p>“Very. Watch him take his lead now. The
chap’s a regular player, all right. Look at that!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span></p>

<p>Tom had wheeled quickly and thrown to shortstop
and Smith had cunningly shot around back
of the bag and slid out of reach of the descending
arm.</p>

<p>“Pollock will never catch him asleep,” said
Mr. Talbot.</p>

<p>Tom tried it again a minute later, after he had
slipped one across on the next batsman, but the
result was the same. Then he gave his attention
to the plate and easily disposed of the Lynton
third baseman. With two out, the Blues breathed
easier, but the trouble was not over for the inning.
Smith, who had proved his ability to take a long
lead and escape punishment, did what he was expected
to and stole third so neatly that, by the
time Sam had stepped aside to avoid the batsman,
there was no use in making the throw. With two-and-two,
Sam called for a low one in the groove,
hoping to fool the batter. But that youth managed
in some way to connect and the ball went
bounding across to shortstop. It would have been
a simple matter to get the ball and field it to first
in time to retire Lynton, but Gordon Smith
“booted” badly and his namesake tallied Lynton’s
first run. The half was over a minute later<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
when Sam, signalling for a wide one, threw to
second and caught the runner sliding.</p>

<p>Some of the Blues did a little grumbling when
they returned to the bench. The general sentiment
was to the effect that Smith ought to be protested.
Either that or the home team should enlist
the services of Mr. Talbot or Mr. Hall. Tom,
however, refused to consider the first plan, declaring
that if they were going to object to
Smith they should have done it before the game
started.</p>

<p>“Then why not ask Mr. Talbot to play?” demanded
Bert Meyers.</p>

<p>“He doesn’t want to. If we can’t lick them any
other way, though, Mr. Hall will go in and pitch
for us.”</p>

<p>“We don’t need anyone else to pitch,”
grumbled Buster Healey. “We need someone to
hit!”</p>

<p>“Try it yourself, Buster,” said Tom. “You’re
up next.”</p>

<p>“That’s all right, but that fellow’s a big league
pitcher. You can’t fool me! Tom Hughes says
he saw him pitch for Cleveland last year.”</p>

<p>“Tommy’s a fibber, I guess. Anyway, don’t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
give up before you get to the plate, Buster. Try
a bunt.”</p>

<p>Buster did try a bunt, and missed. And then
he tried to hit it out and missed. And after that
he tried waiting—and missed. And, when he was
once more seated comfortably on the bench, he
growled uncomplimentary remarks about Pitcher
Smith! There was no scoring in that half of the
second and none in either half of the third. Tom
managed to hold the enemy hitless, although the
Lynton captain came very near to reaching first
on a smash that almost carried third baseman off
his feet. The ball and the runner reached the first
sack at about the same instant, and Mr. George’s
decision might well have been made either way.
He ruled the runner out, however, and quickly
quelled the mutinous murmurs of the Lynton team.
Mr. George, who seemed to be having a very good
time of it, conducted himself like a league umpire
and there was something in his “That’ll do! Play
ball!” that discouraged protest.</p>

<p>The fourth inning opened for Lynton with the
second clean hit of the game and the batsman
reached first with time to spare. Then a hit-and-run
resulted in an out at first and put a man on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
second. But, although there were moments when
things looked desperate for the home team, the
inning finally ended without a tally, Smith being
coaxed by Tom into hitting a fly to the left fielder,
which that youth pulled down. But the Blues
fared no better; in fact, not so well, for, although
Sam, discarding his new method of short-swinging
in favor of slugging, lined out a two-bagger, he
never got beyond that station.</p>

<p>The game had resolved itself into a pitchers’
battle, with Tom barely holding his own against
his more experienced opponent. Only the sharpest
sort of fielding behind him and a really wonderful
catch of a foul by Sam kept Lynton’s score
down to that one lone tally. The onlookers were
getting full value for their money—the Blues, in
view of the more than usual amount of interest in
the deciding contest, had audaciously charged fifteen
cents for admission—and were sitting well
forward in their seats most of the time. Even on
the bench the suspense was beginning to tell. Mr.
Hall had dragged his discolored Panama well over
his eyes, folded his arms, and was watching events
with keen interest. Mr. Talbot, smiling as he always
did smile when he was anxious, made infrequent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
remarks in low tones to which his neighbor
merely nodded.</p>

<p>The fifth passed uneventfully into history, only
three men going to bat for the Blues and four for
Lynton. Smith mowed down his adversaries mercilessly,
seldom pitching more than four balls to
each. Tom had to work harder, and in that first
of the fifth had a narrow escape from punishment
when the Lynton right fielder cracked out what
looked to be good for two bases, but resolved itself
into a remarkable put-out by the Blues’ centre
fielder, who ran almost into left garden for the
ball and then got it an inch from the turf, receiving
from an overwrought audience a burst of applause
that quite embarrassed him.</p>

<p>In the sixth the Lynton catcher started things
off with a slow bunt that third baseman overran
and so reached first base. Steve Arbuckle charitably
scored a hit for the batter. Then the head
of the visiting team’s list came up and things
again looked bad for Amesville. But Fortune
favored the Blues. Tom deceived the next man
and added another strike-out to his credit, and
then, when the third batsman hit across to shortstop,
that youth tossed to second baseman and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
second baseman sped the ball to first, and the
Amesville partisans warmly applauded a very
pretty double-play.</p>

<p>The Blues threatened in their half of the sixth,
but failed to make good the threat. A scratch hit
put Tom on first and an error spoiled what should
have been a double, and the Blues, for the first
time, had two men on. But things fizzled out after
that. Strikes quickly disposed of the next two
batsmen and the third flied out to second baseman
with what, aided by a little luck, might easily have
been a hit.</p>

<p>The stand was shouting for action now. Pitchers’
battles are interesting enough, but the audience
wanted hits. It even demanded them from
Lynton, and perhaps that encouragement helped
to bring about what followed in that first half of
the seventh. A stocky Lynton fielder laid his bat
cosily against one of Tom’s fast ones and went to
first. Tom tried to nail him but failed. The next
batsman bunted toward third, and third baseman,
running in fast, scooped up the ball neatly and
tried for a double. But second baseman was off
his bag when the ball got to him and the runner
beat him by a matter of inches, and the subsequent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
peg to first was too late. That, then, was
the situation when the hard-hitting Mr. Smith
picked out a bat and strolled nonchalantly to the
plate.</p>

<p>“He ought to pass him,” said Mr. Hall
anxiously. Mr. Talbot nodded.</p>

<p>“He will.”</p>

<p>And he did, to the amusement of the Amesville
supporters and the loudly voiced scorn of the
Lynton bench. Smith accepted his fate philosophically,
tossed his bat aside and walked to
first.</p>

<p>Mr. Hall sighed. “Here’s where it goes glimmering,”
he murmured.</p>

<p>“Looks that way,” replied Mr. Talbot. “Bases
full and none out. It’s up to Tom to show some
of the real stuff now.”</p>

<p>“If he’s got enough of it to keep one or two of
those chaps from scoring, I’ll take my hat off to
him,” was the reply.</p>

<p>“Well, you can’t tell. The weak hitters are
coming up and there’s always a good chance for a
double when the bags are filled. Wouldn’t care to
step in there and try your hand, would you?”</p>

<p>But Mr. Hall shook his head most decidedly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
“No, sir! I’m scared as it is! I’d never find the
plate until the bases were cleared!”</p>

<p>The Lynton coachers were shrieking themselves
hoarse and the runners were jumping and shouting
with wild enthusiasm as Sam and Tom met
halfway between plate and mound. Sam, ball in
hand and an eye on third base, talked a moment,
and Tom, a speculative gaze set on Mr. Hall,
nodded. Then Sam handed the ball to him and
walked cheerfully back to the plate, pulling his
mask on, and Tom, hitching his trousers, motioned
the fielders in.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIII" id="CHAPTER_XXIII">CHAPTER XXIII</a><br />
<small>A THROW TO SECOND</small></h2>
</div>


<p>If there is any situation in a ball game which calls
for coolness and steadiness it is that in which the
pitcher finds himself surrounded on three sides by
base-runners and on the fourth by an adversary
whose one desire in life is to hit the ball safely.
And when that pitcher knows, besides, that before
the fracas is over he or his mates must dispose of
three of the enemy, that situation is greatly complicated.
It’s a time when pitcher and catcher
must work together perfectly and when the infield
must back them up as never before. A time, too,
when the slightest miscue proves fatal.</p>

<p>Tom had not only to keep the next three batsmen
from hitting safely, but he must avoid allowing
a long fly, since Lynton could score two runs
on as many outs if the ball went to the outfielders.
And he could give no passes without forcing in a
tally. As Mr. Talbot had said, it was up to him
to show “real stuff.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span></p>

<p>Sam crouched and gave his signal. Shortstop
got it and relayed it to the outfield. Tom wound
his fingers around the ball and the shouting died
down a moment. Then off shot the sphere, the
Lynton batsman staggered away from the plate,
and Mr. George announced “Str-r-rike!”</p>

<p>A burst of applause came from the stand.
Third baseman, who had scuttled in toward the
plate, moved back again. The Blues were talking
back and forth, but their remarks were drowned
by the frenzied shouting of the Lynton coachers.</p>

<p>Another delivery that dropped almost into the
dust behind the plate went for a ball. A third cut
the outer corner, waist-high, and the batsman
swung violently at it and missed. Sam signalled
and spread his hands wide. “Come on now! You
can do it, Tom! Right over and make it good!”</p>

<p>But the ball didn’t go right over. Instead it
curved widely and the batsman pulled his bat
back before he had completed the swing.</p>

<p>“Two balls!” said the umpire.</p>

<p>“Two-and-two, Tom! That’s the stuff, old
man! You’ve got him worried now!” called Sam,
while from the other members of the team came
cheerful shouts of encouragement. “That’s the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
stuff, Tom! He can’t hit you!” “One more just
like it, Tom! Let him hit!” “Give him a good
one, Tom; we’re right here, old man!”</p>

<p>And then, with a change of pace that caught the
batsman napping, Tom sped one over the outer
edge of the plate and the swinging bat was too
late, and Amesville roared and clapped as the disgruntled
batsman turned away.</p>

<p>“One gone!” cried Sam, holding up a finger.
“Here’s the next man, fellows!”</p>

<p>A high one failed to prove the strike that Tom
had meant it to be and he followed it with an out-shoot
that was not offered at and that also went
as a ball. The coachers redoubled their noise
then.</p>

<p>“You’ve got him in a hole! He’s afraid of you,
Sandy! Wait ’em out! Everybody walks now!”</p>

<p>But Tom came back with a slow ball that the
batsman struck at too soon and fouled into the
stand. Again Tom made the same offering and
again the batter was fooled. “Two-and-two,
Tom!” said Sam, pawing the dust between his
knees before he laid three fingers against his
glove. “Only one more now! Cut loose, old man!
Show ’em what you have!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span></p>

<p>But the signal didn’t call for any miracles,
merely for an in-shoot, and third baseman crept in
an inch or two and poised on his toes. And then
away travelled the ball, the bat swung harmlessly,
Sam put up a big mitt, and Mr. George shouted,
“He’s out!”</p>

<p>Mr. Hall’s sigh of relief was audible the length
of the bench in spite of the deafening plaudits of
the crowd beyond, amongst whom none clapped his
hands more vigourously than a late arrival, who
had just squeezed himself into a seat in the front
row, and who now, in order to give vent to his
satisfaction, had let his cane slip away from between
his knees and had dropped the grey gloves
he carried.</p>

<p>Then while the runners on bases, seeing their
opportunity fade away, shouted and leaped and
scuttled back and forth, daring a throw, the Lynton
centre fielder came up, anxious-eyed under a
show of assurance. And Tom pitched, a slow ball
that seemed of two minds about ever reaching the
plate. And the batsman, eager, intense, leaned
forward, swung desperately, and the sound of bat
and ball meeting rang out. Cries—commands—warnings!
First baseman speeding up, Sam whipping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
off his mask, Tom, with upraised hand,
walking toward the plate, head back!</p>

<p>“<em>Tom! Tom!</em>” shouted first baseman, slowing
down.</p>

<p>“Take it!” gasped Sam, dodging aside.</p>

<p>High up against the blue of the sky the ball
floated, a brown speck, and then, momentarily
growing larger, down it rushed. From the enemy
came conflicting shouts of “Catcher’s ball!”
“First baseman’s got it!” “Drop it! Drop it!”
“Can’t get it, Pollock, can’t get it!” And then,
standing astride the plate, the batsman grudgingly
backing away, Tom poised himself, hands waiting.
A step to the left at the last moment and there followed
the comforting thud of ball against glove
and the crisp voice of Mr. George, “Foul! He’s
out!”</p>

<p>The audience shouted loudly, applaudingly, relieving
their suspense. The men on bases strode
away to their places, picking up their gloves and
showing disappointment in every action. The
cheering died away and the Blues went to bat.
One run was needed to tie, but that one run looked
very far away. Smith, the only one of the men
left on bases who had appeared to accept the result<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
philosophically—it was doubtless all in the
day’s work to him—now pulled his glove on again,
swept up the ball from the dirt and faced the batsman.
Comparative silence reigned as the Lynton
catcher crouched and laid fingers against mitt.
Smith nodded imperceptibly and started his wind-up.
And at that moment a polite inquiry came
from the edge of the grandstand:</p>

<p>“Why did Shreveport let you go, Nick?”</p>

<p>There was a slight falter as the ball shot away,
and a quick glance toward the stand as the umpire
announced, “One ball!” A murmur of amusement
arose from the audience. Again came the wind-up
and again came the voice, clear and distinct across
the diamond:</p>

<p>“Hard luck, Nick! Back to the bush, eh?”</p>

<p>Off went the ball and again the umpire disapproved,
while the pitcher, squaring himself toward
the stand, searched the faces there with curious
gaze. He was smiling, but the smile didn’t look
genuine. He failed to find the speaker, for, although
many faces were turned toward a lower
corner of the stand, Smith didn’t think to connect
the remarks with the smartly-dressed, gentlemanly-looking
man of thirty or so, who sat nonchalantly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
grasping a cane and a pair of grey
gloves between his knees. The stand was laughing
and exchanging inquiries. Further away the
occupants were on foot, trying to get a glimpse
of the speaker. “The chap down there in the
derby, I think.” “No, the little man with the
grey coat; smoking a pipe; see him?” “What
did he say, anyhow?” “I couldn’t hear, but whatever
it was that pitcher didn’t like it.” “Glad of
it! He hasn’t any business playing ball with a
lot of boys.”</p>

<p>Smith pitched again, and once more, although
there had been no disturbing comment, he failed
to put the ball over for a strike. Scurrying to
their places, the Amesville coachers whooped and
shouted. “Good eye, George! Wait for your
base!” “You’ve got him now! Here’s where we
start, fellows! Wow!”</p>

<p>Smith rubbed his hand in the dirt, settled the
ball between his fingers and stepped forward.</p>

<p>“Strike—one!” called Mr. George. Lynton
applauded.</p>

<p>Smith got the return and walked back toward
his box, and as he went his gaze again sought the
stand. Those who saw it laughed. The man with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
the grey gloves watched imperturbably. Smith
got the signal, poised with upraised foot.</p>

<p>“What do you get for to-day, Nick?”</p>

<p>Away went the ball, bounded against the plate
and rolled to the net. The batsman raced to first
and Amesville, players and friends, laughed and
shouted gleefully. Angrily Smith slapped the
ball into his glove as it came back, turned, and
threw to first. The baseman, not expecting the
throw, tried for it and failed, and as the ball shot
past his finger-tips and rolled to the seats the
runner dashed for second. He had all the time in
the world to make the bag and reached it standing
up. Smith, still scowling, got his signals, while
from all sides came the howls and shrieks of the
Amesville players. He was fair game now, it
seemed, and in the stand they were kicking their
feet and whistling and shouting across at him.
Whether he was really being paid to pitch for
Lynton none knew, but all were willing to believe
it.</p>

<p>The catcher walked down and conferred a moment
and Smith nodded grudgingly and went back
to the mound. But Smith was annoyed and off his
game for once. Two balls followed in succession.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
Then came a foul. After that a third ball. Amesville
jeered and redoubled her noise. Smith, trying
his best to regain command of the ball, took
much time between deliveries now, wound up
slowly, and sped the ball away with care. But
his time had come, for there was a smart <em>crack</em>,
a streak of grey across the diamond, and the runner
on second was digging for third, while down
the first-base line raced the batter. Well out of
the reach of shortstop or second baseman shot the
ball, head-high, as clean and hard a drive to deep
centre as one would want to see. Centre fielder
reached it as it took its first bound, set himself,
and sped the ball to second baseman and second
baseman turned and pegged it to the plate. But
the Blues had scored the tying run before the ball
reached the catcher, and, although that youth
threw well and quickly to second, the runner
had taken advantage of the throw-in and was
sitting comfortably, if breathlessly, on the
bag!</p>

<p>How Amesville cheered and clapped and
pounded the boards with excited feet! And what
a scurrying and jostling there was about the
bench as Tom, conferring with Mr. Talbot, chose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
a hitter to go to bat for Gordon Smith. It was
Pete Farrar who was at last selected. Pete, although
a pitcher, was a pretty good hitter in the
pinches, and it was Pete who was now to prove
the wisdom of his selection. For Pete landed on
the second ball offered him and sent it arching into
the very right-hand corner of the field! And, although
the ball was caught after a run, it didn’t
reach the infield again until the runner from second
was sliding to third!</p>

<p>One out, then, and a man on third base! And
one run needed to give the lead to Amesville!
And the occupants of the stand on their feet,
shouting and stamping and begging a hit! It was
Sam who walked to the plate, Sam a little bit
nervous and trying to make up his mind whether
to follow Mr. York’s advice and take a short
swing or follow the method he knew best. But
he hadn’t had time to learn Mr. York’s way yet,
and when, after sending a ball, Pitcher Smith
sped one across the outer corner, knee-high, Sam’s
effort went for naught. Another ball followed,
one that passed the end of Sam’s nose and sent
him “bucketting” away from the plate. And
then there was another that looked good and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
again Sam, with shortened bat, tried his level
best to connect with it and only popped a fly behind
the Lynton bench. With the score two-and-two,
Sam let his bat slide down until his hands
were grasping the very end of it and then swung
it well behind his shoulder and waited. After
all, every man to his trade, he thought! Then
Smith was stepping forward and the ball was
coming and Sam—well, Sam was revolving on
one heel and the ball was snugly nestled in the
catcher’s mitt, and Sam was out!</p>

<p>Amesville howled with disappointment and, in
the ardour of the moment, jeered Sam as he walked
back to the bench. Tom, passing on his way to
the plate, smiled reassuringly and murmured,
“Hard luck, Sam!” Sam thought so, too.</p>

<p>On third the runner was dancing back and forth
along the path to the plate, and everyone was
talking as Tom tapped the end of his bat on the
ground, rubbed his hands reflectively on his
trouser legs, and then faced the pitcher. Smith
was recovering now from his brief and disastrous
slump, and Tom secretly had slight hopes of success.
But he looked confident enough and smiled
as he said something to the Lynton catcher and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
received a scowl in reply. The first delivery
whizzed past at lightning speed and Tom knew it
was a strike before the umpire opened his mouth.
Then came a drop that he refused to bite at, although
it looked good until the last moment.
Again he let one go by, a high one that might
have been good or bad, and proved bad. From the
bench came encouraging cries, “You’ve got him
in a hole, Tom!” “Stick to him!” “He’s got
to pitch ’em!” “Here’s the one, Tom! Baste
it!”</p>

<p>Smith was holding the ball under his chin,
watching the catcher’s fingers. He shook his
head. The catcher signalled again. Smith threw
back his arm, raised his foot, and——</p>

<p>“If you’re getting more than your railway fare,
Nick, you’re cheating ’em!”</p>

<p>Smith unwound and pitched, but his tormenter
had settled the fate of that ball! A foot over the
frantically upstretched hand of the catcher it flew,
and Tom, having his wits about him, struck at it
wildly and raced to first, while in from third base,
urged on by a galloping, shrieking coach, came the
runner with the longed-for tally!</p>

<p>Pandemonium reigned! Mr. Hall pounded Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
Talbot on the back and Mr. Talbot slapped Mr.
Hall on the knee, and the other occupants of the
bench danced and capered ecstatically! And
while the catcher was recovering the ball and the
pitcher was guarding the plate, Tom Pollock
rounded first at full speed and sped away to second.
And he reached it long before the ball did,
and then, getting to his feet and slapping the dust
from his clothes, he smiled sweetly at the scowling
baseman.</p>

<p>But he never got further, for a foul arched
softly into third baseman’s glove and that nerve-racking
eighth inning was at last over, with the
Blues leading insecurely by one run.</p>

<p>“If they can hold it they’re all right,” murmured
Mr. Hall.</p>

<p>“They’ve got some good hitters coming up,”
replied Mr. Talbot doubtfully. “Still, if they get
one across that will only tie it up again. Tom
had better pass that man Smith, I guess.”</p>

<p>Lynton came to bat determinedly. But Tom,
encouraged by success, pitched as craftily as he
knew how and the first batsman struck out without
a threat. And it seemed that the next was to
follow the same way when Tom had two strikes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
and one ball on him. But, although the second
man went out ultimately at first, he spoiled several
good ones before he finally hit to shortstop.</p>

<p>“Last man!” called Sam as Smith went to the
plate. In the stand they were on their feet, a few
trickling down the aisles to be ready to start for
home. The man with the grey gloves left his seat
and, unnoticed, strolled along toward the Blues’
bench.</p>

<p>Perhaps Sam made an error of judgment when,
instead of passing Smith, he tried to get him for
the third out, for, in spite of Tom’s best efforts,
the Lynton pitcher found one to his liking and
leaned against it. Had he hit it fairly it would
have tied the score then and there, I think; but he
didn’t, and the ball, arching toward first, came
down safely behind that bag and a few feet inside
the foul line. What might have been expected
then happened. Smith, taking a daring lead, stole
on the second pitch and, although Sam stepped
forward swiftly and threw as straight as an arrow,
slid to the bag in safety.</p>

<p>That caused Tom to falter for the first time that
day and, almost before anyone realised what was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
happening, the next batsman was walking to first.
Lynton, shouting and dancing, saw her hopes revive.
A pinch-hitter was sent in for the next man
up. He was a tall, ungainly youth and looked anything
but dangerous. But looks are sometimes
deceitful. That awkward-appearing youth soon
showed himself a canny batsman, and the first
thing Tom knew he was in the hole with two balls
against him and no strikes! And then, sensing
the psychological moment, Lynton called for a
double steal as Tom sped the next delivery to the
plate. Off for third scudded Smith and down to
second flew the next runner. The ball sailed to
the plate, as nice a strike as you like, and——</p>

<p>“<em>Hit it!</em>” implored the Lynton coachers. “<em>Hit
it!</em>”</p>

<p>But above their cries sounded a voice that
reached Sam with startling, galvanizing effort.</p>

<p><a href="#i_308fp">“From the ear, Sam! From the ear!”</a></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 413px;">

</a><br />
<div class="caption"><a href="#Page_309">“From the ear, Sam! From the ear!”</a></div>
</div>

<p>And Sam, getting the ball in spite of the batsman’s
desperate swing, seized it from his mitt,
jerked his arm back and, without a move from
his place, launched it to second.</p>

<p>In raced Smith from third and down at the
middle base the runner was sliding in a cloud of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
dust. And then it was all over. Down came second
baseman’s hand, the runner slid into it, and
Mr. George, slackening up as he trotted past,
jerked a hand over his shoulder.</p>

<p>“<em>He’s out!</em>” he cried.</p>

<p>Mr. Hall and Mr. Talbot, on their feet, smiled at
each other in satisfaction as the throng surged
over the field.</p>

<p>“Some game!” said the former.</p>

<p>“I should say so! Well, glad to have met you,
Hall. And—er—by the way, in regard to that
Barry case. Seems to me we might—er——”</p>

<p>“My idea exactly,” replied the other heartily.
“I’ll very gladly advise a settlement to my client.
I’ll drop around in a day or two and we’ll talk it
over. Good-bye!”</p>

<p>Mr. Talbot followed the players to the dressing-room,
worming his way through a crowd of
enthusiastic youths, who had gathered to show
their approval of the Blues, and Mr. Hall, seeking
a way from the field, was suddenly confronted
by the gentleman who carried the cane and the
grey gloves. Mr. Hall’s face expressed surprise
and delight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span></p>

<p>“Johnny!” he exclaimed. “Where’d you drop
from?”</p>

<p>Mr. York chuckled as he shook hands. “Hello,
old man,” he said. “You look almost as flabbergasted
as Sam Craig did when I yelled.”</p>

<p>“Was that you bellowing like a bull?” laughed
Mr. Hall. “I might have known it. You’re always
right there with the advice, Johnny.”</p>

<p>“Well, it happened to be good advice this time.
It won the game.”</p>

<p>“Oh, certainly,” scoffed the other. “Craig
and the others had nothing to do with it!”</p>

<p>“Craig did what I told him to,” replied Mr.
York untroubledly. “If he hadn’t, he’d never
have nailed that man at second and the score
would have been tied at this minute—unless the
other chaps had won. Come on and let’s get out
of here.”</p>

<p>“When did you arrive?” asked Mr. Hall when
they were on the street.</p>

<p>“About an hour ago. Ran down to Columbus
last night, got there early this morning, and
found I could catch a train over here and see you
for a few hours and still get back to Mount Placid
to-morrow morning. My train goes at nine-something,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
and I’ll have to change in the middle of the
night. I call that a real proof of love and affection,
John.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but you’re a silly chap if you think I’m
going to let you go on to-night.”</p>

<p>“Sorry, but I have to be home in the morning.
Topsy gets back and I must be there to meet her.
Well, how are you?”</p>

<p>“Bully, thanks. I needn’t ask how you are;
you look as strong as an ox; besides, I got news
of you from young Craig. By the way, that was
a nice letter you wrote to me about him.”</p>

<p>“By Jove, I didn’t, did I? Meant to, but quite
forgot it. Have you seen him?”</p>

<p>“Yes, he came around one morning and we had
a chat. Nice boy.”</p>

<p>“Yes, he is. Deserving, too. I never saw a
chap his age who looked more like a real catcher,
John. I want to do something for him; want to
get him into college.”</p>

<p>“Hm,” said Mr. Hall. “Can’t you afford it?”</p>

<p>Mr. York laughed ruefully. “Yes, but he
won’t let me. At least, not the easy way. I offered
to get him a college position and he turned
me down; said it wouldn’t be honest.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span></p>

<p>“Good for him! What’s your plan, then?”</p>

<p>“Well—I haven’t any yet. Thought I’d consult
you. That reminds me that I invited him to
meet us at your office after dinner.”</p>

<p>“My office? Why didn’t you have him come to
the club?”</p>

<p>“Well, the office is on my way to the station,
for one thing, and I won’t have much time here.
Thought you and I could have some dinner together
and a quiet smoke and then walk down to
the office and see Craig for a few minutes. All
right?”</p>

<p>“Surely, but we must get there before eight or
we’ll have to climb nine flights of stairs. The
elevators stop at eight.”</p>

<p>“I think I told him about eight. By the way,
did you hear me having fun with Nick Turner?”</p>

<p>“Who’s he?”</p>

<p>“Why, that fellow who pitched for Lynton.”</p>

<p>“Smith, you mean? So his name is Turner,
eh? Was that you who hurled insults at him from
the stand?”</p>

<p>“Insults, nothing!” Mr. York chuckled. “I
only asked him why he left Shreveport and how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
much he was getting to-day and a few things like
that. Only asked for information, John.”</p>

<p>“Well, you broke up the game, you old
schemer! Who is this chap?”</p>

<p>“Nick Turner? Pitched two years ago for
Shreveport. Never was much good, though.
Knew him the minute I saw him pitch. I dare
say those Lynton boys made up a ten-dollar purse
to get him to work for them to-day. They ought
to be spanked. I was glad you fellows here licked
them without any outside assistance.”</p>

<p>“They talked about having me pitch for them,”
replied Mr. Hall, with a smile. “I believe I
agreed to do it if necessary.”</p>

<p>“Glad you didn’t, old man. By the way, I
telephoned out to the Country Club when I didn’t
find you at your office, and they said you weren’t
there. Just by accident I heard of the ball game
from a conductor on a trolley-car and said to myself,
‘I’ll bet a million the old loafer’s out there!’
Didn’t find you in the stand, though, and didn’t
think of looking for you below; not until you and
another chap got to thumping each other like two
kids; saw you then. Those kids played a pretty
good game of ball, didn’t they? And wasn’t that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
fellow who pitched for Amesville the same one
we saw last spring?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Tom Pollock. He’ll make his mark some
day, I guess.”</p>

<p>“Sure to; he’s a good pitcher.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t mean as a pitcher,” replied the other.
“I meant as a man. I suppose, though, you can’t
understand judging anyone except by his ability
to play baseball, you crazy fan!”</p>

<p>“I like that! Crazy fan, eh? What were you
doing to-day? Why weren’t you in your office attending
to business? How do you expect to get
on in the world if you go to ball games and such
puerile affairs?”</p>

<p>“Oh, Saturday’s a half holiday here,” Mr. Hall
laughed. “Here we are. Did you leave your bag
here?”</p>

<p>“Yes, the hall porter took charge of it. Show
me a tub of cold water, John. I’m two inches
deep in train dust!”</p>

<p>It was a few minutes before eight when Sam,
turning into Main Street at the corner of the
Adams Building, saw Mr. Hall and Mr. York just
entering the big doorway. He caught up with
them at the elevator and as they were whisked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
aloft past dark corridors he had to listen to much
praise.</p>

<p>“You played a regular air-tight game, Sam,”
declared Mr. York. “And that throw to second
at the last was a marvel. What did you think
when you heard me yell?”</p>

<p>“There wasn’t time to think anything,” replied
Sam. “If I’d stopped to think I’d never
have thrown that way, sir. You see, I haven’t
much chance to try it yet.”</p>

<p>“But you <em>had</em> tried it, hadn’t you?”</p>

<p>“Not in a game, sir; just in practise the other
day.”</p>

<p>“Well, you certainly pulled it off in grand
style! And I want to tell you that if you’d thrown
your old way you’d never have caught him. He
had an awful lead from first and ran like a rabbit.
This our floor?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Mr. Hall, “unless you and Craig
want to stay there and ride up and down and talk
baseball.”</p>

<p>“This man, Sam,” warned Mr. York, “is an
awful hypocrite. He pretends he doesn’t care a
thing about the game, but some time I’ll tell you a
few facts about him; like the time he dented in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
immaculate silk topper of a perfectly respectable
old gentleman at the White Sox park in
Chicago.”</p>

<p>“Well, I bought him a new one,” laughed Mr.
Hall, as he unlocked his door. “Enter, gentlemen.”</p>

<p>“Seems to me,” said Mr. York, pausing to sniff
suspiciously, “I smell smoke. Don’t you?”</p>

<p>“Smoke? No, I don’t think so. Probably from
the railroad. It comes up here when the wind’s
right. Smell anything, Craig?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, I believe there is a smoky smell.”</p>

<p>“Well, come on. This building’s fireproof,
anyway.”</p>

<p>“It’s what?” demanded Mr. York as he allowed
himself to be urged through the door.</p>

<p>“Fireproof, or what they call fireproof.”</p>

<p>“It’s about as fireproof as a can of gasoline,”
said the architect as Mr. Hall closed the door and
turned the lights on. “You’ve got nice brick and
stone walls, but your partitions are only plaster
over lathing and your floors are the best quality
of ‘fat’ pine. If this thing ever did catch on fire
and get a nice start it would go like a bundle of
shavings. Where’s your fire escape?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span></p>

<p>“Fire escape? Why, at the back, I think; down
the corridor.”</p>

<p>“It might be a good idea to find out,” returned
the other drily. “Well, Sam, how did the hike
go?”</p>

<p>“Very well, sir. I found them at Norrence all
right and we got back to camp three days later.”</p>

<p>“And now you’re back at school, I suppose.”</p>

<p>“Not until Monday, sir. Will you have this
chair, Mr. Hall?”</p>

<p>“No, no, sit still. I’m going to open these windows
and get some air in here. Wonderful how
this warm weather keeps on. I suppose it’s cool
up where you are, Johnny.”</p>

<p>“Y-yes, but not freezing. Did Sam here tell
you that he paid a short visit to Greysides,
John?”</p>

<p>“Yes, he told me about it. Must have been
frightfully dull for him, poor chap!”</p>

<p>“He didn’t say so, but maybe it was.”</p>

<p>“I—I had a fine time, sir,” said Sam earnestly.
The others laughed.</p>

<p>“We had some fine old talks, anyway, didn’t
we? That brings me to what I wanted to say,
Sam. About that college idea, you know. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
haven’t worked anything out yet, but—— Look
here, John, I certainly do smell smoke, I tell
you!”</p>

<p>“Of course you do. I’ve just opened the windows.
It comes from the railroad yards.”</p>

<p>“It doesn’t smell like coal smoke,” Mr. York
objected. “Still—let me see, what was I talking
about? Oh, about that college scheme, Sam.
Ever think you’d like my profession?”</p>

<p>Sam considered. Then he shook his head.
“No, sir, I’ve never thought about it,” he answered.</p>

<p>“No inclination toward architecture, eh?”</p>

<p>“I’ve never thought about it, Mr. York.”</p>

<p>“Ever build anything?”</p>

<p>“I built a hen-house once,” replied Sam, with
a smile. “I like to do that sort of thing, but——”</p>

<p>“Where’d you get your plan?”</p>

<p>“Nowhere; I mean I just—just went ahead and
put it together.”</p>

<p>“But you planned it in your head first, didn’t
you?”</p>

<p>“I suppose I did,” Sam confessed. “You see,
there was the framework.”</p>

<p>“Did you do it all yourself? How big was it?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span></p>

<p>“About twelve by eight. I did it all myself,
usually after school or in the morning. It—it
wasn’t much.”</p>

<p>“Ever do any drawing?”</p>

<p>“I’ve tried to.”</p>

<p>“Like good pictures, handsome buildings,
statuary—such things?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, very much.”</p>

<p>“Still you don’t think you’d care to create
them, eh?”</p>

<p>“Indeed I would, Mr. York, but I don’t believe
I ever could. I’d like to build a real house some
time, though. You wouldn’t have to know so
much to do that, would you?”</p>

<p>Mr. York laughed and Mr. Hall smiled sympathetically.
“Why, yes, Sam, in order to build a
house you’ve got to know quite a bit. Look here,
why don’t you think it over and decide whether
you’d like to be an architect? If you would, you
can start your college course with that end in
view; and in the summers there’s a place in our
office you can have. The wages wouldn’t be large,
but you’d learn the business and if you made
good I guess we’d be glad to give you a real job.
You’d have to work hard, though, and study<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
like the dickens. What do you think about
it?”</p>

<p>“I’d like it!” declared Sam decidedly. “If I
really could learn enough to—to be an architect——”</p>

<p>“Pshaw,” interrupted Mr. Hall, “it’s no trick,
Craig. All the fellows in my class at college who
couldn’t make a living at laying brick or driving
express wagons went in for architecture. All,
that is, except John York. He had so much
money he didn’t have to make it, and we persuaded
him to be an architect because we thought
he could do as little harm in that profession as
any.”</p>

<p>Sam smiled obligingly and Mr. York threatened
his friend with a paper-weight.</p>

<p>“You give it a good thinking over, Sam,” he
continued. “Talk to your folks about it. You
don’t have to decide before you get to college.
And as to college, why, you’ll just have to make
it somehow, old man. We’ll keep our eyes open
and see if we can’t find a scheme. John and I
will get our heads together”—Mr. York was interrupted
by a fit of coughing—“and work out
something. Look here, John, this place is worse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
than Pittsburg! Why, the room is full of smoke.
Close the windows if you don’t want me to choke
to death!”</p>

<p>Mr. Hall started to comply with the request,
then apparently changed his mind, and walked to
the door that led to the corridor. “It certainly
is smoky,” he muttered, “and it can’t all come
from the railroad.” He opened the door and
staggered back before the cloud of dense and
acrid smoke that billowed in. The others leaped
to their feet with exclamations of alarm. Mr.
Hall slammed the door shut again and faced
them.</p>

<p>“Fire,” he announced in level tones. “The
flames are coming up the elevator well, Johnnie.”</p>

<p>“So much for your fireproof building,” replied
Mr. York, seizing his hat and stick and gloves
from the desk. “Which way out, please?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” was the reply. “We’re cut
off from the stairs and the elevators aren’t running.
Couldn’t use them if they were, I guess.”</p>

<p>“But the fire escape, man! Where’s that?”</p>

<p>“We’ll try it, but it looks bad, Johnnie. I wonder—Put
your head out, Craig, and see if there’s
any sign of excitement below. No? Then it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
hasn’t been seen.” Mr. Hall strode to the telephone
and yanked the receiver off. “Fire department,”
he said. “Emergency!” There was a
moment’s wait. Mr. York opened the door again
and once more the clouds of smoke seethed into
the room, whirling and eddying as they met the
air from the windows. He looked up and down
the corridor, returned, closing the door again, and
shook his head as his gaze met that of the man at
the telephone.</p>

<p>“Hurry up, John,” he said quietly. “It
doesn’t look pretty to me.”</p>

<p>“Hello! Hello! Fire department? The Adams
Building’s on fire. What? I’m John Hall. Yes.
I’m in my office on the tenth floor. Everything
looks to be pretty hot underneath. We’re
going to try to make the fire escape. Good-bye.”</p>

<p>Mr. Hall dropped the receiver back to the hook,
looked about the office, took a step toward his safe,
shrugged his shoulders, and moved toward the
door. “Come on, Johnnie,” he said quietly.
“We’ll have to make a run for it. Craig, keep
close to us. If we can’t make it we’ll have to come
back here and wait for ladders. All ready? Slip<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
out and I’ll shut this door again. Wait! How
about handkerchiefs over our faces?”</p>

<p>“Right!” agreed Mr. York. “Got one, Sam?
That’s the ticket! Now then, hold your breath
and keep together. Which way, John?”</p>

<p>“To the right, past the stairway. Come on!”</p>

<p>Sam never quite forgot that dash for safety.
It was a horrible nightmare while it lasted.
Somewhere near the stairway a solitary electric
bulb had faintly illumined the gloom of the long
corridor when they had ascended, but there was
no sign of it now. Instead, from the shaft in
which the two elevators were operated, a lurid
glow poured up, rising and falling as though
somewhere in the depths of the building a giant
furnace was being stoked. With the light of the
flames ascended billows of dun-coloured smoke and
showers of sparks, and, listening as they crouched
for their dash past the well, they heard the growling
roar of the fire, with now and then the sudden
crackling of the eager flames which, even as they
looked, sent a tiny tongue licking at the flooring.
The fire escape was at the rear of the building,
down the length of the long corridor, and to reach
it they must win past that veritable crater of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
heat and smoke. Thrice they tried it and thrice
they were beaten back, their eyes blinded, their
lungs choked with the scorching fumes. And
then, endurance at an end, they staggered desperately
back to the office, suffered torments while
Mr. Hall fumbled for the knob, and at last, gasping
and sobbing, sought relief at the open windows.</p>

<p>It was a full minute before anyone spoke. Then,
drawing a deep breath into his parched lungs,
Mr. Hall said quietly, with a twisted sort of
smile, “Rather silly being roasted alive here,
Johnny!”</p>

<p>“We sha’n’t be. They’ll have us out of here
in a minute. There they come now! Hear?”</p>

<p>From somewhere far below came the shriek of
the engine siren, sounding nearer and nearer,
and the clang of the bells. And at that moment
the light in the office went out and they were in
darkness.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXV" id="CHAPTER_XXV">CHAPTER XXV</a><br />
<small>SAM SIGNALS FOR A FAST ONE</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Tom Pollock was working late that evening at
Cummings and Wright’s. Baseball activities had
put him behind with his correspondence and he
was trying to catch up with it. Only the light over
his desk was burning and the rest of the store was
dim and empty. As he sealed and addressed his
final letter he glanced at the little tin clock before
him. The hour was just short of nine. In the act
of opening a drawer to get stamps, he paused with
outstretched hand and listened alertly. From
down Main Street came the shrill, unmistakable
whistle of Amesville’s single auto-engine. Tom
gathered his letters into a pile, seized his cap,
switched out the light, and hurried to the door.</p>

<p>As he stepped onto the sidewalk and turned
the key behind him the whistle at the electric
light plant burst on the air and, around the corner
of Alton Street, a few blocks above, a horse-drawn
engine sprang into sight, bell clanging,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
sparks flying. Tom joined the throng which,
springing seemingly from the very pavement, was
hurrying down the main street. Several blocks
below, he could see the auto-engine spouting red
sparks into the air. The Alton Street hitch,
straining at their collars, thudding the pavement
with flying hoofs, raced past, followed in a moment
by the hose-cart. Bells were ringing at
every street corner, it seemed, by the time Tom
reached the place where the police were herding
the crowd back into the cross streets and where
the crew of the auto-engine were already connecting
with the hydrant at the corner. As the crowd
gave back before the commands of the police,
Tom caught sight of several rubber-coated firemen
disappearing into the broad entrance of the
Adams Building nearly opposite.</p>

<p>For the next few minutes confusion reigned.
The hook-and-ladder trundled up, more engines
reached the scene, the throb of the pumps began,
fuel wagons dashed here and there, parting the
crowds, a third alarm boomed over the city. Ladders
rose in air, grew in length, swayed, and tottered
against the tall building which reared its
slender front high above the surrounding roofs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
But Amesville’s new sky-scraper had been built
only a few months, while her fire-fighting apparatus
was far older, and it was at once evident
that the longest of the extension ladders would
not reach above the sixth story. The crowd still
laughed and joked excitedly. The Adams Building
was said to be fireproof and so the most that
could happen would be the burning-out of an office
or two, scarcely serious work for the whole
department, they thought. Of course, it was right
to be on the safe side, but a third alarm seemed
rather absurd, and when, almost immediately,
four blasts of the big whistle sounded, many
thought the Chief had gone crazy!</p>

<p>So far no sign of fire was to be seen outside the
building. Its tier on tier of dark windows gave
no hint of what was going on inside. Not a light
showed anywhere, save when a fireman appeared
at the door with a lantern. But at last the blackness
behind the windows paled, took on a murky-red
tinge, and smoke began to billow out at the
doorway. A great gasp of surprise and horror
arose from the watchers. Here, then, was no
mere incident to bring an hour’s amusement, but
a veritable tragedy!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span></p>

<p>Further and further away the throngs were
pushed and ropes were strung across the streets.
Tom found himself jammed against a doorway
on Bennett Street, his view of a corner of the big
building almost cut off by a broad-shouldered man
in front of him. Searching backward with his
foot, he found a step and managed to ascend it,
those behind good-naturedly giving way. From
somewhere came the rumour that Chapinsville
and even Bow City had been called on for apparatus.</p>

<p>“It would take two hours to get engines here
from Bow City,” said an excited little man at
Tom’s elbow. “Anyhow, they ain’t got enough
pressure to fight that fire. And they ain’t got
the ladders.”</p>

<p>“Good thing it didn’t start in the daytime,”
said another man. “Lots of folks would have
been burned up, I guess.”</p>

<p>“Don’t reckon there’s anyone in there now,
do you?”</p>

<p>“No. They stop the elevators at eight. Besides,
there wasn’t a light showing when I got
here, and that was before the auto-engine came.”</p>

<p>“I heard,” said the broad-shouldered man in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
front of Tom, “that there’s a man on the tenth
floor. Don’t know how true it is. Hope it’s
not. If he’s up there he’ll have to burn—or
jump!”</p>

<p>The voice was familiar and Tom leaned forward
until he caught a glimpse of the speaker’s face.
It was Mr. George, and Tom spoke to him eagerly.</p>

<p>“Don’t they have life nets, Mr. George?” he
asked.</p>

<p>“Hello, Tom! I guess so, but you’ve got a
mighty poor chance to strike a net when you jump
from the tenth story. I dare say it’s just a fake.
Folks imagine all sorts of things at a time like
this.”</p>

<p>“Do you suppose they can save the building?”
Tom asked.</p>

<p>“I don’t know how bad the fire is. One fellow
said the whole inside was burning, but I don’t
know how much he knew about it.”</p>

<p>“Wish I could see better,” muttered Tom.</p>

<p>“Well, maybe if you’ll keep close to me we can
get a better view,” replied the other. “I’ve got
a badge here somewhere. Come on and keep hold
of me.”</p>

<p>Slowly they wormed their way through the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
throng that packed the street solidly from side to
side. It seemed a long time before they at last
reached the rope and were challenged by a policeman.
Mr. George’s badge was sufficient, however,
and the officer raised the rope. But when Tom
started to follow he was thrust back.</p>

<p>“Here, you, back of the rope there!”</p>

<p>“He’s with me, Lieutenant,” said Mr. George.
“It’s all right.”</p>

<p>The officer, who was not even a sergeant, looked
doubtful, but Mr. George’s air of authority, and
the compliment, also, perhaps, had the desired
effect and Tom was allowed to pass. Before them
the end of the street lay well-nigh empty, and
they hurried along it to the corner of Main Street.
Here engines were pumping, lines of hose
stretched like mammoth serpents across the wet
pavements, and rubber-clad fighters hurried by.
About the entrance to the building a knot of
privileged persons gathered and thither Mr.
George and Tom went. Leaky hose drenched
them and busy firemen shouldered them. Shouts
and commands sounded above the steady roar of
the engines. Two men came through the doorway
from the smoky murk beyond. One was the Chief,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
the other an assistant. They dripped with water
as they paused where Mayor Kelland stood.</p>

<p>“Can’t reach him from inside, Mr. Mayor,”
said the Chief incisively. “Everything’s burning
around the well. We’ve got to try the scaling-ladders,
I guess. Either that or the net. Tell
Cassidy, Jim, to start up on the front. Hall’s
office is on the side of the building about halfway
between front and staircase. You get on the roof
over there and see if you can find him. He hasn’t
shown himself yet, and it may be he got out, but
I’m blessed if I see how he could. And no one’s
seen him around, as far as I can learn. Get a
move on, Jim!”</p>

<p>Following the others, Tom and his companion
hurried around the side of the building, stumbling
over pulsating hose, dodging spouting geysers
from leaky connections. From the further sidewalk
the dark wall of the building arose straight
in air, a many-windowed cliff of stone and brick.
Eager and anxious eyes swept as best they could
the empty windows of the tenth floor. But a
stone cornice at the eighth story cut off the view
to some extent, while the lights from the street
failed far short of that height.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span></p>

<p>“He said Mr. Hall,” whispered Tom troubledly.
“You don’t suppose it’s John Hall, do you?
Why, he was out at the game this afternoon!”</p>

<p>“Isn’t there something up there at that ninth
window from the corner?” asked Mr. George,
peering intently upward. “Have a look, Tom.
See where I mean? Something’s moving. It’s a
man! He’s standing on the window-ledge! Chief,
he’s up there! You can see him now!”</p>

<p>Far up a form appeared dimly against the darkness
of a window and a shout arose from the
group below, and at the moment something struck
the pavement with a crash.</p>

<p>The Chief darted forward and picked up a tattered
sheet of white paper, from which as he unfolded
it broken particles of a glass paper-weight
tinkled. “Lantern here!” he shouted. A man
held a light and the Chief read the message aloud,
“We’re cut off, three of us. Find someone to
throw a ball with twine on it from opposite roof.
We’ll light matches to give location. Hurry.
Smoke bad, and fire close.</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Hall.</span>”<br /></p>

<p>The Chief grunted. “Throw a ball from opposite
roof, eh?” He looked upward toward the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
top of the five-story bank building behind them.
“Where’d we get a ball and who’d throw it if we
had it?” he demanded impatiently.</p>

<p>“I’ll find a ball, sir, and twine,” cried Tom.
“And—and I think I could throw it across.”</p>

<p>The Chief turned and viewed him doubtfully
an instant. Then, “Go to it,” he said briskly.
“Get your ball and hurry back here. Jerry, you
go with him and get him through. Come back
here to the bank. Gus, tell Murphy to break an
entrance there unless the folks have opened up.
It’s a poor chance, but we’ll try it. They’ll never
get up there with the scaling-ladders, and I’d
hate to see those fellows jump.”</p>

<p>Tom didn’t hear the last of it, though, for he
was already racing around the corner of Main
Street, followed by the fireman. At the rope he
let the latter break a way through the crowd and
pressed closely at his heels. A block away they
were free of the throng and Tom sprinted to the
store. A minute later he was inside and pulling
boxes from a shelf. On the way he had thought
it all out. He must have balls, a half-dozen to be
on the safe side, and the strongest and lightest
silk fishing line there was in stock, and some brass<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
thumb tacks. The latter he had to search for, and
it seemed that he would never find them. But he
did, at last, and, his pockets bulging with baseballs,
he hurried out again, locked the door, and
raced back toward the fire, the panting fireman
at his heels. It seemed that they would never
make their way through the closely jammed
crowd, but Tom’s guide used voice and elbows to
good effect, and presently they were again ducking
under the rope.</p>

<p>At the entrance to the building across from the
burning sky-scraper some thirty or forty persons
awaited them; the Chief, several assistants, two
men with axes, Mayor Kelland, Mr. George, some
newspaper reporters, and many other privileged
ones.</p>

<p>“All right?” demanded the Chief. “Up we go!
Not too many, now! Don’t get in the way!”</p>

<p>Tom panted up the stairs beside Mr. George.
“I got half a dozen balls,” he said, “and some
fishing line. I guess you’d better try it. I’m—I’m
tuckered. Are they still there?”</p>

<p>“Yes, the fellow’s still standing on the ledge.
The Chief tried to tell him through his trumpet
that we’d sent for balls, but I don’t know whether<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
he heard. They started up with the scaling-ladders,
but had to give it up. Didn’t have nerve
enough, I guess. Here we are, Tom! Up the
ladder and through the small door there.”</p>

<p>In another moment they were out on the roof,
their feet scraping over the pebbles. It was less
dark up here than it had been below, for the stars
were bright and shed a soft light upon them as
they crept cautiously in the wake of a swinging
lantern toward the edge of the roof nearest the
Adams Building. The wall of that structure
loomed darkly like the side of some giant cliff,
but in a moment they picked out the waiting figure
at the window, still high above them. A spark of
yellow light appeared and waved between the
wide-spread legs of the figure on the sill.</p>

<p>“They’re lighting matches,” said the Chief.
“All ready there, young fellow?”</p>

<p>“Just a moment,” panted Tom. He was coiling
his fishing line on the roof in wide loops while
Mr. George was fixing an end of it to a ball with
the aid of a thumb tack. From across the dim
canyon of the side street and well up toward the
blue-black sky the little yellow lights flared and
burned, and died away. The throng on the roof<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
grew silent as Mr. George, borrowing the Chief’s
trumpet, advanced to the very edge of the roof.</p>

<p>“Hello, there!” he shouted.</p>

<p>Very faintly above the noise from below came
the answering hail.</p>

<p>“Hello!”</p>

<p>“Can you catch this?”</p>

<p>“I think so! Aim for the light!”</p>

<p>“Who are you?”</p>

<p>“Sam Craig!”</p>

<p>Tom uttered a cry of surprise, and——</p>

<p>“Give me the ball, Mr. George,” he said
steadily. “I’ll do it, sir! Tell Sam I’ll throw it,
please. And tell him not to reach too far, because
we can try again, sir.”</p>

<p>“Hello, there! Tom Pollock will throw it!
Don’t reach for it! We’ve got plenty of balls!
Get that?”</p>

<p>“All right!” came the answer, clearer now.
“Tell Tom, ‘One finger’!”</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span></p>




<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVI" id="CHAPTER_XXVI">CHAPTER XXVI</a><br />
<small>CATCHER CRAIG</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Tom smiled a bit tremulously as he heard Sam’s
plucky answer. “One finger, eh?” he thought.
Well, it couldn’t be that, for in their signal code
one finger meant a fast ball, and it was beyond
Tom’s or anyone else’s power to throw a fast ball
at the angle confronting him. Judging the distance
as best he might, his gaze on the tiny light
that glowed five stories above him, he stepped
slowly backward across the roof. Finally he
stopped.</p>

<p>“How far is it, do you think?” he asked Mr.
George.</p>

<p>“About ninety feet, I’d say,” was the answer.</p>

<p>“Just the distance between bases,” muttered
Tom. “I’ll try to get it to him coming down, I
guess.”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t, Tom. Sam’s used to catching
them straight. Sock it right at him. If he can
see it he’ll get it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well,” answered Tom doubtfully. He fixed
his fingers around the ball, saw that the twine ran
unentangled to the coil, which Mr. George had
laid beside him, and took a long breath. Now
that the moment had come he was losing his nerve,
or so it seemed to him. The others drew aside in
silence, only a whisper disturbing the stillness up
there, although from below came the throb of the
busy engines, the murmur of the throngs, the
shrill signalling of an engine asking for fuel.
Mr. George raised the trumpet to his mouth
again.</p>

<p>“All ready, Sam! Get it, boy!”</p>

<p>There was a faint answer, drowned by the quick
scraping of Tom’s shoes on the loose gravel, and
off sped the ball, grey-white in the half-darkness,
up and away toward the dimly illumined window
and the motionless form poised there. There was
a quick gasp from the thrower as he recovered.
Then a moment of anxious silence broken by a
murmur of disappointment. The ball had gone
three feet wide of the window and, although Sam
had been seen to lean dangerously to the right,
he had failed to touch it, and it had rebounded
from the wall and fallen to the street. Eager<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
hands found the line and began to pull it back over
the edge of the roof.</p>

<p>“Pretty near,” said Mr. George cheerfully.
“A little more to the left next time, Tom. You’ve
got the distance all right.”</p>

<p>“My foot slipped on the gravel,” panted Tom.
“He’s saying something, isn’t he?”</p>

<p>The Chief commanded silence and from across
the darkness came Sam’s voice untroubledly,
“Three feet further to the left, Tom! I almost
had it! Make it be good! Right over now in the
groove!”</p>

<p>“Plucky young fellow,” growled the Chief.
“Got that ball yet?”</p>

<p>“It came off,” answered someone. “Here’s
the cord.”</p>

<p>Mr. George quickly stripped the tin-foil from
another clean, white ball, looped the end of the
cord once more and once more pushed the thumb
tack into the tough leather with a grunt.
“There you are, Tom,” he said. “Here’s
luck!”</p>

<p>“I guess you’ll have to hurry,” said a newspaper
man. “Looks as if the fire was in there
now, don’t it?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span></p>

<p>It did, for the window, dark before, now shone
dull red and Sam’s form was silhouetted plainly
against it. Tom seized the ball, measured his distance
again, silently prayed for success, stepped
forward, and threw. <a href="#i_frontis">A breathless silence then.
The figure on the ledge settled back.</a> The ball was
lost in the shadow of the tall building. Still those
on the roof waited and still no sound came,
until, suddenly, faintly, there was a hail from
above.</p>

<p>“Got it! Tie on your rope!”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It was nearly a fortnight later. Sam, returning
at dusk along Main Street from the ball field
after an afternoon of fall practice, paused in
front of Cummings and Wright’s and, one hand
thoughtfully fingering the change in his pocket,
viewed admiringly the array of football goods
displayed in one big window. He had more than
half promised the captain of the high school eleven
to try for the team as soon as baseball was
shelved for the winter. If he did, he reflected,
he’d have to spend quite a little money for togs,
and, now that he was firmly resolved to go to
college next year, he could ill afford to part with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
any of his slender horde. Ruminating, he turned
his gaze up the street, along which the lights were
already beginning to flash. Against the darkening
sky the smoke-blackened shell of the Adams
Building towered empty and forlorn. A frown
creased Sam’s forehead as his eyes rested on the
tall structure with its broken windows and grimy
walls. He had not yet got so he could recall that
experience without a sudden sickening sensation
at his heart. He sometimes wondered if he would
ever be able to forget that awful quarter of an
hour up there, the anxious period when, held
firmly by Mr. Hall and Mr. York, he had waited
there on the outer ledge and hoped against hope
that Tom’s aim would be true, or the hazardous
descent by the rope with the flames almost licking
at their heels. They had made him go first,
when it had seemed that there was scarce time
for all to escape. He remembered how quietly
and calmly Mr. Hall had instructed him about
wrapping the rope about his leg and lowering
himself down, and how Mr. York had assured
him that if he went slowly and kept his head he
would reach the ground safely. Well, it was
something to have gone through such a test with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
men like those, he reflected, and now that it was
over—his eyes narrowed as he gazed thoughtfully
up the busy street—well, now that it was all over
he was almost glad that it had happened. Somehow,
life had seemed finer and bigger since that
night!</p>

<p>A tapping on the broad pane beside him caused
him to look around. At the back of the window
Tom Pollock was knocking on the glass with a
hockey stick and beckoning him inside. Sam
smiled faintly, nodded, and entered. The store
held few customers, and none on the sporting
goods side. Tom closed the panel at the back of
the window and turned with a smile.</p>

<p>“Ah,” he said, “Mr. Craig, I believe! Champion
ten-story catcher of the Sky-scraper League!
What were you doing out there, Sam? Going to
sleep?”</p>

<p>“Just—just thinking,” replied Sam soberly.</p>

<p>“You want to break yourself of that,” responded
Tom, with a warning shake of his head.
“It’ll get to be a habit. What’s new? How did
practice go? Sorry I had to cut to-day.”</p>

<p>“Pretty fair, I think. I guess I’ll have to call
it off soon. A lot of the fellows are trying for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
the football team. Sidney left to-day; Buster,
too.”</p>

<p>“Yes, you couldn’t keep Sid away from a pigskin
if you tied him. By the way, Mr. Hall was
in here about an hour ago asking for you. Said
I was to tell you to go around to the club this
evening. Wants to see you about something. I
think he said he’d had a letter from Mr. York.”</p>

<p>Sam nodded. “Yes, I guess I know what it is,”
he said. “I had a letter from Mr. York this
morning; or, rather, a note. He—he’s got the
contract, Tom.”</p>

<p>“For the new Adams Building? That’s good.
Hope they’ll make it fireproof this time. How is
he?”</p>

<p>“All right, I guess. He didn’t say. He didn’t
write much; only five or six lines. He said his
firm had got the contract and that—that he’d have
a job for me next month.”</p>

<p>“Really? Bully for you, Sam! Say, that’s
fine! I’m awfully glad. What are you going to
do—stand on the top of the building and catch
beams and things?”</p>

<p>“N-no, I guess it will be something about the
office. I don’t know yet. But I’m mighty glad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
because I guess I’ll be able to make enough to
start college next fall.”</p>

<p>“Pshaw, you won’t need money, Sam! Why,
I’ll bet there isn’t a college in the country that
wouldn’t be tickled to get as celebrated a chap as
you! You know, old man, you’re a bit of a hero.
Mr. Hall says you had a whole page to yourself
in one of the New York papers on Sunday.”</p>

<p>“I wish they wouldn’t,” said Sam. Then a
twinkle danced in his eyes. “Anyway, they had
you in it, too, I’ll bet.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, but I wasn’t important. He said
there was a fine picture of you standing on a window-ledge
with mask and mitt and leg guards! I
must get that paper and see it.” And Tom
chuckled.</p>

<p>Sam smiled a little over the idea of the mask
and mitt. Then, soberly, he said: “You were the
real hero of that stunt, Tom. If you hadn’t thrown
that ball just right the time you did—well, you
wouldn’t have had many more tries!”</p>

<p>“No, that’s a fact,” agreed the other gravely.
“It wasn’t any time to get our signals mixed,
was it, Sam?”</p>

<p>“No, and you—you certainly were fine, Tom. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
don’t know whether I ever exactly told you how—how
awfully grateful——”</p>

<p>“Don’t mention it!” exclaimed Tom hurriedly.
Then, with a grin, “It was a pleasure, sir, I assure
you,” he said gaily. “I always esteem it a
great honour to pitch to Catcher Craig.”</p>

contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
